gcd.pl
% gcd(1.5),gcd(2.5), write_store(user). % this one loops - donno why -
% but is seems a bad idea to do gcd in floats

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

minmax.pl

compiles but what is the query ?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

monkey.pl

uses find_constraint/2 - what is the SWI equivalent ?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

osf.pl

uses 
:- chr_option(already_in_store, on).
added the recommended clauses ...


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

scheduling.pl

findall_constraints does not exist in KUL CHR

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

type.pl

uses ordering.pl - tried to use it - 'chr lock' puts things in other
order and makes things weird ... the thing relies on @ ordering of
variables anyway

this didn't run in SICStus 3.12 - maybe never did
! CHR Compiler: no handler defined

made it run in SICStus by including ordering.pl directly
