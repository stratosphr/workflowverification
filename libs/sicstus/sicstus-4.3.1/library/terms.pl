%@  This library module provides miscellaneous operations on terms.
%@  Exported predicates:
%@  
%@  @table @code


%@  @item subsumeschk(@var{+General}, @var{+Specific})
%@  @PLXindex {subsumeschk/2 (terms)}
%@  is true when @var{Specific} is an instance of @var{General}.  It
%@  does not bind any variables.
%@  
%@  This predicate is identical to the built-in @code{subsumes_term/2}
%@  and it is only present for backwards compatibility.
%@
subsumeschk(General, Specific) :-
	subsumes_term(General, Specific).

%@  @item subsumes(@var{+General}, @var{+Specific})
%@  @PLXindex {subsumes/2 (terms)}
%@  is true when @var{Specific} is an instance of @var{General}.  It will bind
%@  variables in @var{General} (but not those in @var{Specific},
%@  except when @var{+General} and @var{+Specific} share variables) so that @var{General}
%@  becomes identical to @var{Specific}.
%@  
%@  @c [PM] 4.3 ISO Prologue and SWI warns that binding the variables may be error prone and rarely needed.
%@  In many cases, binding variable is not really desirable, in which case
%@  @code{subsumes_term/2} should be used instead.
%@  If unification is in fact wanted, it may be better to make this explicit in your code by
%@  using @code{subsumes_term/2} followed by an explicit unification, e.g.@: @code{subsumes_term(G,S), G=S}.


subsumes(General, Specific) :-
	subsumes_term(General, Specific),
	General = Specific.


%@  @item variant(@var{+Term}, @var{+Variant})
%@  @PLXindex {variant/2 (terms)}
%@  is true when @var{Term} and @var{Variant} are identical modulo renaming of variables,
%@  provided @var{Term} and @var{Variant} have no variables in common.


variant(Term, Variant) :-
	subsumes_term(Term, Variant),
	subsumes_term(Variant, Term).



%@  @item term_subsumer(@var{+Term1}, @var{+Term2}, @var{-Term})
%@  @PLXindex {term_subsumer/3 (terms)}
%@  binds @var{Term} to a most specific generalisation of @var{Term1} and @var{Term2}.
%@  Using Plotkin's algorithm [Machine Intelligence 5, 1970], extended
%@  by Dan Sahlin to handle cyclic structures.

%@  @item term_hash(@var{+Term}, @var{-Hash})
%@  @PLXindex {term_hash/[2,3,4] (terms)}
%@  Equivalent to @code{term_hash(Term, [], Hash)}.
%% %@  @PLXindex {term_hash/[2,3,4] (terms)}
%% %@  If @var{Term} is ground, an integer hash value corresponding to @var{Term} 
%% %@  is unified with @var{Hash}.  Otherwise, the goal just succeeds.

term_hash(Term, Value) :-
	Modulus = 0x10000000,		% 1<<28 for 32-bit arch small integer, also used for 64-bit
	%% prolog:'$term_hash'(Term, -1, Modulus, Value).
	Depth = -1,
	which_code('default', Which),
	Options = Which,
	prolog:'$term_hash_4_0_5'(Term, Options, Depth, Modulus, Value).


%@  @item term_hash(@var{+Term}, @var{+Options}, @var{-Hash})
%@  @var{Options} is a list of options,
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @item algorithm(@var{Algorithm})
%@  
%@  @var{Algorithm} specifies which hash function to use. An atom, one
%@  of,
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  
%@  @item default
%@  
%@  This is currently the same as @code{jenkins}. This is the
%@  default. If we ever see a need to change the default hash
%@  algorithm again then the algorithm denoted by @code{default} may
%@  change but the algorithm denoted by the other names, like
%@  @code{'sicstus-4.0.5'}, will not change.
%@  
%@  @item jenkins
%@  
%@  Based on the algorithm ``lookup3'' by Bob Jenkins, see
%@  @uref{http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html}.
%@  
%@  @item hsieh
%@  
%@  Based on the algorithm ``SuperFastHash'' by Paul Hsieh, see
%@  @uref{http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/hash.html}. Despite the
%@  name neither this nor any other choice of algorithm significantly
%@  affects the speed of @code{term_hash/3}.
%@  
%@  @item sdbm
%@  
%@  Based on the well known algorithm ``sdbm''.
%@  
%@  @item 'sicstus-4.0.4'
%@  
%@  This is the algorithm used up to SICStus Prolog 4.0.4
%@  (inclusive). It is only present to provide backwards
%@  compatibility. It is not as good as any of the above
%@  algorithms. Note that this atom needs to be quoted.
%@  
%@  This algorithm produces hash values that may differ
%@  between platforms.
%@  
%@  @item 'sicstus-4.0.5'
%@  
%@  This is the same as @code{jenkins}. I.e.@: the default since
%@  SICStus Prolog 4.0.5. Note that this atom needs to be quoted.
%@  
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  @noindent there are some other (not as good) algorithms available
%@  for the curious, see the source for detail.
%@  
%@  Unless otherwise noted, the hash value will be identical across
%@  runs and platforms.
%@  
%@  @item range(@var{Range})
%@  
%@  The resulting hash value will be non-negative and less than the
%@  upper bound specified by @var{Range}. @var{Range} should be either
%@  a positive integer, or an atom, one of,
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  
%@  @item infinite
%@  
%@  Do not constrain the hash value. Currently all hash algorithms
%@  produce an unsigned 32-bit integer. Note that this may be too
%@  large to be used for first-argument indexing on 32-bit platforms.
%@  
%@  @item smallint
%@  
%@  Ensure the resulting hash value is a @use{small integer}, e.g.@:
%@  suitable for first argument indexing. This is the same as
%@  specifying a range of @code{2^28} on 32-bit platforms and
%@  @code{2^60} on 64-bit platforms.
%@  
%@  @item smallint32
%@  
%@  Ensure the resulting hash value is in the 32-bit platform range
%@  of small integers, i.e.@: the same as a range of @code{2^28}.
%@  
%% not documented
%% %@  @item smallint64
%@  
%@  @item default
%@  
%@  The same as @code{smallint32}. This is the default. This ensures
%@  that, by default, the same hash value is computed for the same
%@  term on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
%@  
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  @item depth(@var{Depth})

%@  Specifies how deep to descend into the term when calculating the
%@  hash value.

%@  If @code{Depth} is a non-negative integer the subterms up to depth
%@  @var{Depth} of @var{Term} are used in the
%@  computation. Alternatively, if @code{Depth} is the atom
%@  @code{infinite}, all subterms of @var{Term} are relevant in
%@  computing @var{Hash}. In the latter case @var{Term} must be
%@  acyclic.

%@  In this context the @emph{depth} of a @use{term} is defined as
%@  follows: the (principal @use{functor} of) the @use{term} itself
%@  has depth 1, and an @use{argument} of a @use{term} with depth
%@  @var{i} has depth @var{i+1}. Note that this is similar to, but not
%@  the same as, the value computed by @code{term_depth/2}.


%@  For legacy reasons a @var{Depth} of -1 is treated the same a
%@  @code{infinite}.
%@  
%@  @item if_var(@var{IfVar})
%@  
%@  Specifies what to do if a variable is encountered in the term
%@  (i.e.@: to the specified depth). @var{IfVar} should be an atom, one of,
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  
%@  @item error
%@  
%@  An instantiation error is thrown.
%@  
%@  @item ignore
%@  
%@  The variable is ignored and the hash algorithm continues with the
%@  other parts of the term.
%@  
%@  @item value(Value)
%@

%@  The hash algorithm stops, the intermediate hash result is
%@  discarded and @code{Hash} is bound to @code{Value}. There is no
%@  restrictions on @code{Value}, it need not be an integer or even be
%@  ground.

%@  @item default

%@  This is the same as @code{value(_)}, i.e.@: @code{term_hash/3}
%@  just succeeds without binding @code{Hash}. This is the default.

%@  This is useful when the hash value us used for first-argument
%@  indexing. This ensures that if the (possibly variable-valued) hash
%@  values for @var{Term1} and @var{Term2} are @var{Hash1} and
%@  @var{Hash2}, respectively, then if @var{Term1} and @var{Term2} are
%@  unifiable (to the specified depth) then so are @var{Hash1} and
%@  @var{Hash2}.

%@  For other use cases it is probably more appropriate to specify
%@  @code{if_var(error)}.

%   These relations were available in the public domain library with
%   different names and inconsistent argument orders.  The names are
%   different so that "contains", "freeof" and so forth can be used
%   by your own code.  free_of_var is used by the "unify" package.
%   The _term predicates check for a sub-term that unifies with the
%   Kernel argument, the _var predicates for one identical to it.
%   In release 2.0, the *_var predicates were modified to continue
%   using the identity (==) rather than unifiability (=) test, but
%   to cease insisting that the Kernel should be a variable.  When
%   the Kernel is a variable, they continue to work as before.

%   Package: term_depth
%   Author : Richard A. O'Keefe
%   Updated: 04/15/99
%   Purpose: Find or check the depth of a term.

/*  Many resolution-based theorem provers impose a Depth Bound on the
    terms they create.	Not the least of the reasons for this is to
    stop infinite loops.  This module exports five predicates:

	term_depth(Term, Depth)
	depth_bound(Term, Bound)

	term_size(Term, Size)
	size_bound(Term, Bound)

	length_bound(List, Bound)

    term_depth calculates the depth of the term, using the definition
	term_depth(Var) = 0
	term_depth(Const) = 0
	term_depth(F(T1,...,Tn)) = 1+max(term_depth(T1),...,term_depth(Tn))

    Mostly, we couldn't care less what the depth of a term is, provided
    it is below some fixed bound.  depth_bound checks that the depth of
    the given term is below the bound (which is assumed to be an integer
    >= 1), without ever finding out what the depth actually is.

    term_size calculates the size of the term, defined to be the number
    of constant and function symbols in it.  (Note that this is a lower
    bound on the size of any term instantiated from it, and that
    instantiating any variable to a non-variable must increase the size.
    This latter property is why we don't count variables as 1.)

	term_size(Var) = 0
	term_size(Const) = 1
	term_size(F(T1,...,Tn)) = 1+term_size(T1)+...+term_size(Tn).

    size_bound(Term, Bound) is true if the size of Term is less than
    or equal to the Bound (assumed to be an integer >= 0).  Note that
    size_bound/2 and depth_bound/2 will always terminate.

    length_bound(List, Bound) is true when List is a list having at
    most Bound elements.  Bound must be instantiated.  If List ends
    with a variable, it will be instantiated to successively longer
    proper lists, up to the length permitted by the Bound.  This was
    added when I noticed that the depth of a list of constants is
    its length, and we already have a length/2, but did not have a
    length_bound.

    In the DEC-10 Prolog library, this was depth.pl, defining
    depth_of_term/2 and depth_bound/2.
