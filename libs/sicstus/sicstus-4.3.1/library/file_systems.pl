%@  @cindex files
%@  @cindex directories
%@  This module provides operations on files and directories, such as renaming,
%@  deleting, opening, checking permissions, accessing members of.
%@  
%@  The following principles have been observed:
%@  
%@  @itemize @bullet
%@  @item 
%@  An absolute distinction is drawn between files and directories.
%@  The set of operations
%@  one can usefully perform on a directory is different from the set
%@  one can perform on a file:  for example, having
%@  write permission to a directory allows the user to create new files in
%@  it, not to rewrite the entire directory!  If any routine in this package
%@  @c [PM] 4.0 Liar liar, this was never true. Now fixed so that file_exists is not true for directories
%@  tells you that a ``file'' exists, you can be sure that it means a
%@  @c [PM] 4.0 We do not distinguish between ``regular'' and other (non-directory-)files.
%@  @c ``regular'' file.
%@  file and not a directory (and vice versa for ``directory'' exists).
%@  @item 
%@  The directory scanning routines do not actually open the files they
%@  find.  Thus finer discriminations, such as that between
%@  source and object code, are not made.
%@  @item 
%@  @c [PM] 4.0 new
%@  All paths are expanded as if by @code{absolute_file_name/3}.

%@  @c [PM] 4.0 who cares
%@  @c @item 
%@  @c The predicate names
%@  @c are made up of complete English words in lowercase, separated 
%@  @c by underscores, with no abbreviations.
%@  @item 
%@  Every predicate acts like a genuine logical relation insofar as it
%@  possibly can.
%@  @item 
%@  If anything goes wrong, the 
%@  predicates
%@  raise an error exception.  Any time that a predicate
%@  fails quietly, it should mean ``this question is meaningful, but the
%@  answer is no''.
%@  @item 
%@  The directory scanning routines insist that the directory argument
%@  name a searchable directory.
% [PM] 4.1 SPRM 11591 Clarify behavior
%@  @item 

%@  On Unix-like systems, symbolic links are followed by default and
%@  symbolic links that can not be followed are treated as
%@  non-existing. This means @code{file_exists/1} will fail if passed
%@  such a ``broken'' link and that neither
%@  @code{file_members_of_directory/1} nor
%@  @code{directory_members_of_directory/1} et al.@: will return such
%@  a link.
%@  
%@  On Windows, symbolic links (and other @use{reparse points}) are
%@  @emph{not} followed when enumerating directory contents with
%@  @code{file_members_of_directory/1} nor
%@  @code{directory_members_of_directory/1} et al.@: and are not
%@  returned for these predicates.
%@  
%@  The behavior for symbolic links (and reparse points) may change on
%@  all platforms in the future to ensure a well defined and
%@  consistent behavior on all platforms.

%@  
%@  To see @emph{all} members of a directory you can use
%@  @code{absolute_file_name/3} with a @code{glob('*')} option.

%% %@ [PM] 4.0 this was never true (it always, and still, barfs if taking property of a non-existing object)
%% %@  But the ``property'' routines
%% %@  are to be read as ``there exists a thing of such a type with such
%% %@  a property'', and quietly fail if there is no such file or
%% %@  directory.

%@  @end itemize
%@  
%@  The ``property'' routines use the same simplistic access control
%@  model as that used by the @code{absolute_file_name/3}
%@  @code{access/1}-option. @xref{mpg-ref-absolute_file_name}, for details.

/*  file_member_of_directory([Directory, [Pattern, ]]Name, Full)
    enumerates file Names in the given Directory which match the
    given Pattern.  The Directory defaults to '.', the current
    directory.  The Pattern defaults to '*', which matches anything.
    It is impossible to supply a Pattern without also supplying a
    Directory.  The Name argument will be unified with a simple
    file name, and the Full argument will be unified with a full
    path name, including the Directory and the Name both.  As a
    special case, a leading ./ will be stripped.  Note that Full
    will be absolute if Directory is absolute, relative if relative.
    This routine only matches visible *file* names.  Even names
    which start with a dot are considered to be visible.

    directory_member_of_directory([Directory, [Pattern, ]]Name, Full)
    is exactly like file_member_of_directory except that it only
    matches visible *directory* names.  Even names which start with
    a dot a considered to be visible, but as a special case to stop
    looping, the names '.' and '..' are NOT matched.

%@  
%@  @item owner_user_name

%@  like @code{'@var{DOMAIN}\@var{NAME}'} will be used.
%@  
%@  If for some reason the name cannot be found it will fall back to using
