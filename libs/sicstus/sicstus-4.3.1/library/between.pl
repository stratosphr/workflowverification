%@  This library module provides some means of generating integers.
%@  Exported predicates:
%@  
%@  @table @code

%@  @item between(@var{+Lower}, @var{+Upper}, @var{-Number})
%@  @PLXindex {between/3 (between)}
%@  is true when @var{Lower}, @var{Upper}, and @var{Number} are integers,
%@  and @var{Lower =< Number =< Upper}.  If @var{Lower} and @var{Upper} are given,
%@  @var{Number} can be tested or enumerated.  If either @var{Lower} or @var{Upper}
%@  is absent, there is not enough information to find it, and an
%@  error will be reported.

	).

	Goal = between(Lower,Upper,Point),
	must_be(Lower, integer, Goal, 1),
	must_be(Upper, integer, Goal, 2),
	must_be(Point, integer, Goal, 3).



%%  between1(Lower, Upper, Point)
%   enumerates values of Point satisfying Lower =< Point =< Upper,
%   where it is already known that Lower =< Upper and Point was a
%   variable.  A purer version of this is left as a comment.

%@  @item gen_nat(@var{?N})
%@  @PLXindex {gen_nat/1 (between)}
%@  is true when @var{N} is a natural number.  If @var{N} is a variable, it will
%@  enumerate the natural numbers 0,1,2,... and of course not terminate.
%@  It is not meant to be applied to anything but integers and variables.

gen_nat(N) :-			% gen-erate nat-ural
	(   integer(N) ->	% if we aren't to generate it

	gen_nat(M, N).		% generate natural >= M

%@  @item gen_int(@var{?I})
%@  @PLXindex {gen_int/1 (between)}
%@  is true when I is an integer.  If I is a variable, it will
%@  enumerate the integers in the order 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, &c.
%@  Of course this sequence has no end.
%@  It is not meant to be applied to anything but integers and variables.

gen_int(I) :-			% gen-erate int-eger
	(   integer(I) ->	% if we aren't to generate it
	    true		% just succeed.
	;   var(I) ->		% if we are to generate it,

%@  @item repeat(@var{+N})
%@  @PLXindex {repeat/1 (between)}
%@  (where @var{N} is a non-negative integer) succeeds exactly @var{N} times.
%@  You can only understand it procedurally, and really it is only
%@  included for compatibility with some other Prologs.

%@  @item numlist(@var{?Upper}, @var{?List})
%@  @PLXindex {numlist/[2,3,5] (between)}
%@  is true when @var{List} is the list of integers @var{[1, ..., Upper]}.
%@  For example, @code{numlist(3,L)} binds @code{L = [1,2,3]}.

numlist(Upper, List) :-
	numlist(1, 1, Upper, _, List).

%@  @item numlist(@var{?Lower}, @var{?Upper}, @var{?List})

%@  For example, @code{numlist(1, 3, L)} binds @code{L = [1,2,3]}.

	numlist(Lower, 1, Upper, _, List).

%@  @item numlist(@var{?Lower}, @var{?Step}, @var{?Upper}, @var{?Length}, @var{?List})
%@  is true when @var{List} is the list of integers @var{[Lower, Lower+Step, ..., Upper]} and
%@  of length @var{Length}.
%@  For example, @code{numlist(L,2,U,S,[1,X,Y,Z])} binds @code{L=1, S=4, U=7, X=3, U=5, Z=7}.
