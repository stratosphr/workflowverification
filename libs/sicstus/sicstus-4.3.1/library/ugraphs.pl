/*  Adapted from shared code written by Richard A O'Keefe */

%@  This library module provides operations on directed graphs.
%@  An unweighted directed graph (ugraph) is represented as a list of
%@  @var{(vertex-neighbors)} pairs, where the pairs are in standard order
%@  (as produced by @code{keysort/2} with unique keys) and the neighbors of
%@  each vertex are also in standard order (as produced by @code{sort/2}), and
%@  every neighbor appears as a vertex even if it has no neighbors
%@  itself.
%@  
%@  An undirected graph is represented as a directed graph where for
%@  each edge @var{(U,V)} there is a symmetric edge @var{(V,U)}.
%@  
%@  An edge @var{(U,V)} is represented as the term @var{U-V}.
%@  
%@  A vertex can be any term.  Two vertices are distinct iff they are
%@  not identical (@code{==}).
%@  
%@  A path is represented as a list of vertices.  
%@  No vertex can appear twice in a path.
