/*  In earlier releases of the Dec-10 Prolog, C Prolog, and Quintus
    Prolog libraries, the predicate free_variables/4 was defined
    elsewhere (typically not.pl), and used freely by any library
    file which included that one.  However, I don't really want to
    make free_variables/4 a public predicate of library(not), so
    this predicate has been split out into its own file.

    This is support for not.pl, setof.pl, and foreach.pl.  It is
    not meant for general use.

    In August 1987, term_variables/3 was added to support the new
    grouped_{bag,set}_of/4 predicates.

    In April 1989, all of the code for free_variables/4 was scrapped.
    It had always been our intention to have free_variables/4 check
    for quantifiers ONLY in "code" rather than "data".  Note that it
    should really look inside the meta-arguments of meta_predicates.
    The built-in setof/3 and bagof/3 use a version of free_variables/4
    which does this.

%@  @cindex aggregation
%@  Data base query languages usually provide so-called "aggregation"
%@  operations.  Given a relation, aggregation specifies
%@  @itemize @bullet
%@  @item a column of the relation
%@  @item an operation, one of @{sum,max,min,ave,var@} or more
%@  @end itemize
%@  
%@  One might, for example, ask
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      PRINT DEPT,SUM(AREA) WHERE OFFICE(_ID,DEPT,AREA,_OCCUPANT)
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  and get a table of <@var{Department},@var{TotalArea}> pairs.  The Prolog
%@  equivalent of this might be
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      dept_office_area(Dept, TotalArea) :-
%@              aggregate(sum(Area),
%@                  I^O^office(I,Dept,Area,O), TotalArea).
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  where @var{Area} is the column and @code{sum(_)} is the aggregation operator.
%@  We can also ask who has the smallest office in each department:
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      smallest_office(Dept, Occupant) :-
%@              aggregate(min(Area),
%@                      I^O^office(I,Dept,Area,O), MinArea),
%@              office(_, Dept, MinArea, Occupant).
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  This module provides an aggregation operator in Prolog:
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@          aggregate(Template, Generator, Results)
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  where:
%@  @itemize @bullet
%@  @item
%@  @var{Template} is @var{operator}(@var{expression})
%@  or  @var{constructor}(@var{arg},...,@var{arg})
%@  @item
%@  each @var{arg} is @var{operator}(@var{expression})
%@  @item
%@  @var{operator} is @code{sum | min | max}  @{for now@}
%@  @item
%@  @var{expression} is an arithmetic expression
%@  @end itemize
%@  
%@  @var{Results} is unified with a form of the same structure as @var{Template}.
%@  
%@  Things like mean and standard deviation can be calculated from
%@  sums, e.g. to find the average population of countries (defined
%@  as "if you sampled people at random, what would be the mean
%@  size of their answers to the question 'what is the population
%@  of your country?'?") we could do
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  ?-  aggregate(x(sum(Pop),sum(Pop*Pop)),
%@                Country^population(Country,Pop),
%@                x(People,PeopleTimesPops)),
%@      AveragePop is PeopleTimesPops/People.
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  Note that according to this definition, @code{aggregate/3} FAILS if
%@  there are no solutions.  For @code{max(_)}, @code{min(_)}, and many other
%@  operations (such as @code{mean(_)}) this is the only sensible
%@  definition (which is why @code{bagof/3} works that way).  Even if
%@  @var{bagof/3} yielded an empty list, @var{aggregate/3} would still fail.
%@  
%@  Concerning the minimum and maximum, it is convenient at times to
%@  know Which term had the minimum or maximum value.  So we write
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      min(Expression, Term)
%@      max(Expression, Term)
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  and in the constructed term we will have
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      min(MinimumValue, TermForThatValue)
%@      max(MaximumValue, TermForThatValue)
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  So another way of asking who has the smallest office is
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      smallest_office(Dept, Occupant) :-
%@              aggregate(min(Area,O),
%@                      I^office(I,Dept,Area,O), min(_,Occupant)).
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  Consider queries like
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      aggregate(sum(Pay), Person^pay(Person,Pay), TotalPay)
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  where for some reason @code{pay/2} might have multiple solutions.
%@  (For example, someone might be listed in two departments.)
%@  We need a way of saying "treat identical instances of the
%@  Template as a single instance, UNLESS they correspond to
%@  different instances of a Discriminator."  That is what
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@      aggregate(Template, Discriminator, Generator, Results)
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  does.  
%@  @c Thus
%@  @c 
%@  @c     NU Prolog               Quintus Prolog
%@  @c     count(D, Goal, C)       aggregate(count, D, Goal, C)
%@  @c     max(X, Goal, M)         aggregate(max(X), Goal, M)
%@  @c     min(X, Goal, M)         aggregate(min(X), Goal, M)
%@  @c     sum(X, D, Goal, S)      aggregate(sum(X), D, Goal, S)
%@  
%@  Operations available:
%@  @table @code
%@  @item count
%@  @code{sum(1)}
%@  @item sum(@var{E})
%@  sum of values of @var{E}
%@  @item min(@var{E})
%@  minimum of values of @var{E}
%@  @item min(@var{E},@var{X})
%@  @code{min(@var{E})} with corresponding instance of @var{X}
%@  @item max(@var{E})
%@  maximum of values of @var{E}
%@  @item max(@var{E},@var{X})
%@  @code{max(@var{E})} with corresponding instance of @var{X}
%@  @item set(@var{X})
%@  ordered set of instances of @var{X}
%@  @item bag(@var{X})
%@  list of instances of @var{X} in generated order.
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  bagof(X, G, B) :- aggregate(bag(X),    G, L).
%@  setof(X, G, B) :- aggregate(set(X), X, G, L).
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  @c In 1989, two new operations were added:
%@  @c     aggregate_all(Template, Generator, Results),
%@  @c     aggregate_all(Template, Discriminator, Generator, Results).
%@  @c They are hybrids between the aggregate/[3,4] operations and the
%@  @c {set,bag}_of_all/3 operations found in library(setof).  They insist
%@  @c that all the variables in Generator should be captured by the
%@  @c Template, the Discriminator, or existential quantifiers.  This means
%@  @c that it makes sense for them to return zero counts, zero sums, empty
%@  @c sets, and empty bags.
%@  
%@  Exported predicates:
%@  
%@  @table @code
----------------------------------------------------------------------*/


%@  @item forall(@var{:Generator}, @var{:Goal})
%@  @PLXindex {forall/2 (aggregate)}
%@  succeeds when @var{Goal} is provable for each true instance of @var{Generator}.
%@  Note that there is a sort of double negation going on in here (it
%@  is in effect a nested pair of failure-driven loops), so it will
%@  never bind any of the variables which occur in it.

forall(Generator, Goal) :-
	call(( Generator, ( Goal -> fail ; true ) -> fail ; true )).


%@  @item foreach(@var{:Generator}, @var{:Goal})
%@  @PLXindex {foreach/2 (aggregate)}
%@  for each proof of Generator in turn, we make a copy of @var{Goal} with
%@  the appropriate substitution, then we execute these copies in
%@  sequence.  For example, @code{foreach(between(1,3,I), p(I))} is
%@  equivalent to @code{p(1), p(2), p(3)}.
%@  
%@  Note that this is not the same as @code{forall/2}.  For example,
%@  @code{forall(between(1,3,I), p(I))} is equivalent to
%@  @code{\+ \+ p(1), \+ \+ p(2), \+ \+ p(3)}.
%@  
%@  The trick in @code{foreach/2} is to ensure that the variables of @var{Goal} which
%@  do not occur in @var{Generator} are restored properly.  (If there are no
%@  such variables, you might as well use @code{forall/2}.)
%@  
%@  Like @code{forall/2}, this predicate does a failure-driven loop over the
%@  @var{Generator}.  Unlike @code{forall/2}, the @var{Goals} are executed as an ordinary
%@  conjunction, and may succeed in more than one way.

foreach(Generator, Goal) :-
        % [PM] 4.3 Prevent SPIDER from complaining about passing the closure Generator as non-meta argument to GeneratorBound/4.
        GeneratorBound = Generator,
	free_variables(Goal, GeneratorBound, [], FreeVariables),
        % [PM] 4.3 Prevent SPIDER from complaining about passing the closure Goal as non-meta argument to save_instances/3.
        GoalTemplate = Goal,
	save_instances(FreeVariables, GoalTemplate, Generator),
	conj_instances(FreeVariables, Conjunction),
        % [PM] 4.3 Note that the hardwired 'user' module context is
        % safe (albeit pointless) here since all goals in Conjunction
        % will have explicit module qualifications.
	call(user:Conjunction).



%@  @item aggregate(@var{+Template}, @var{+Discriminator}, @var{:Generator}, @var{-Result})
%@  @PLXindex {aggregate/4 (aggregate)}
%@  is a generalisation of @code{setof/3} which lets you compute sums,
%@  minima, maxima, and so on.  

aggregate(Template, Discriminator, Generator, Result) :-
	parse_template(Template, Pattern),
	setof(Discriminator-Pattern, Generator, Set),
	(   foreach(_-T,Set),
	    foreach(T,List)
	do  true
	),
	process_results(List, Pattern, Result).


%@  @item aggregate(@var{+Template}, @var{:Generator}, @var{-Result})
%@  @PLXindex {aggregate/3 (aggregate)}
%@  is a generalisation of @code{findall/3} which lets you compute sums,
%@  minima, maxima, and so on.  

aggregate(Template, Generator, Result) :-
	parse_template(Template, Pattern),
	bagof(Pattern, Generator, List),
	process_results(List, Pattern, Result).


/*  A general note:
    The simplest way of coding these predicates would be to copy the
    definitions of aggregate/[3,4] replacing setof/3 by set_of_all/3
    and bagof/3 by bag_of_all/3.  I have chosen not to do that for
    two reasons:
    (a) calling free_variables/4 here means that I can report the
	actual call in any error message, not the internal *_of_all/3.
    (b) at the moment I call setof/3 and bagof/3 because they are quite
	a bit faster than the library *_of_all/3 predicates.  That is
	going to change:  in the 2.5 final release findall/3 will be
	available to users, which means that set_of_all/3 and bag_of_all/3
	can be about as fast as setof/3 and bagof/3.
    Reason (a) will still hold, so in the 2.5 final release, make the
    changes suggested by the comments.

%   parse_template(+Template, -Pattern)

%   The cases for Pattern are

%	any(V)		was a source variable.  This should be reported

%	set(Term)	was set(Term).  The final result will be a list
%			in standard order with no duplicates.  It will
%			NOT have set(_) wrapped around it.
%	bag(Term)	was bag(Term).  The final result will be a list
%			in the order generated, with duplicates if they
%			were generated.  It will NOT have bag(_) around it.
%	sum(Expr)	was sum(Expr).  The final result will be
%			the sum of the values of the Exprs.  It will NOT
%			have sum(_) wrapped around it.
%	count		was count.  We could use sum(1), but this is
%			more compact.
%	min(Expr)	was min(Expr).  The final result will be the
%			minimum of the values of the Exprs.  It will NOT
%			have min(_) wrapped around it.
%	max(Expr)	was max(Expr).  The final result will be the
%			maximum of the values of the Exprs.  It will NOT
%			have max(_) wrapped around it.
%	min(Expr,Term)	was min(Expr,Term).  The final result will be the
%			pair min(N,T) where N is the minimum of the values
%			of the Exprs and T is the corresponding Term.  This
%			DOES have the min(_,_) wrapper.
%	max(Expr,Term)	was max(Expr,Term).  The final result will be the
%			pair max(N,T) where N is the maximum of the values
%			of the Exprs and T is the corresponding Term.  This
%			DOES have the max(_,_) wrapper.
%	pat(F,List)	F is an atom and List is a list of patterns.  The
%			final result is F(List') where List' is the sequence
%			of values of elements of List.  For example,
%			sum(X)/count in the Template would be represented
%			as pat(/,[sum(X),sum(1)]) in the Pattern, and the
%			final result might be 273/9.
%	[H|T]		an optimisation of pat(.,[H,T]).
%	con(Term)	An optimisation of pat/2 where the Term is ground.

/*  In the first draft of this file, the intention was to use
	setof_stack(Term)
    where Term is [] or found(Instance) or Key-Instance.
    However, this involves indexing on the functor, which is rather
    pointless here.  So the current version uses
	setof_stack(_, Term)
    to avoid indexing.  The low-level operation which supports the
    built-in operations setof/3 and bagof/3 is more than 3 times
    faster than the version of findall/3 in this library.
*/

/*  save_instances/3 and list_instances/3 are used by bag_of/3 and
    set_of/3 when there are free variables (which are collected as
    the Key).  They are not used by either version of findall.
    They are in this module so that they can see the setof_stack/1
    predicate.  Using such a predicate was a new feature in the
    2.3 release, which has the effect that the 'recorded' data base
    is now entirely free to customers.
