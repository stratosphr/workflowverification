%			       Abstract
%
%  This module handles class declarations for the objects package.
%  The goal of this package is to provide a powerful object oriented
%  extension to Prolog that is very efficient.  Most object oriented
%  Prolog extensions use the Prolog database to store information,
%  rendering these packages less useful for large applications due to
%  the performance problems of the dynamic database.  This package
%  uses C-style structures to represent objects where possible,
%  providing faster access and much faster modification of objects.
%
%  This package also improves efficiency by using Prolog's
%  'term_expansion/6' facility.  This allows us to generate efficient
%  code for sending messages and for accessing and setting slots.

/****************************************************************
			     Introduction

The goal of this package is to provide the following features.  How
each is implemented is described below.

++description

    Multiple inheritance
		Determine at compile-time which ancestor class a method is
		inherited from, and the offset in the descendant class of
		that class's slots.  Add this offset at runtime to the
		actual object when sending the message.
    Object itself knows its type
		A word in memory just before each instance is class name
		atom.
    Automatic generation of accessor/setter methods
		Slots declared 'public' have accessor and setter methods
		automatically generated.
    All external slot references go through methods
		The special forms for accessing and setting slots of a class
		are not available outside the definition of that class.  Use
		setter and accessor messages to get at slots outside of
		methods for that class.
    Compile-time inheritance
		Inheritance is precomputed.  Sending a message to an object
		jumps to the appropriate method clause with only one
		intervening (trivial) procedure call.
    As much done at compile-time as possible
		Simple methods, including most setting and accessing of
		slots, avoid even the one intervening procedure call.
		Sending these messages costs no more than an ordinary Prolog
		predicate call.
    Term-valued slots
		Implemented with a separate dynamic predicate for each slot
		name, indexed by object address.
    Can store instance of descendant class in slot
		If a slot is declared to be of class x, and y is a
		descendant class of x, this allows you to put in instance of
		class y in the slot.  Also, you can have a slot of type
		object which can hold an object of any class.  This is
		implemented by reading the atom just before the object to
		find its type when accessing the slot.  Similarly, we check
		the type of an object being stored in the slot to verify
		that it is a descendant of the specified class.
    Instance methods
		allow different instance of the same class to have different
		methods for the same message.  Like term slots with bodies.
		This is a powerful way to implement callbacks: the object
		sends itself a message, which can be different for each
		instance.
--description

These features would have been nice to have, but aren't implemented yet:

++description
    Garbage collector
		The most important omission of this package. This would
		require the cooperation of the Prolog system.  Prolog would
		really have to do the garbage collection, as there is no way
		for the objects package to know whether an object is
		referred to from the Prolog stack (or heap).
    Method selection based on multiple args, like Common Lisp
		Can't do it.  We must have circumscribed class definitions,
		so we can generate inherited code at compile-time.  This
		would allow methods to be defined anywhere.  Life wouild be
		better if we could generate code at LINK time.
    Parameterized types
		parameters would be stored in each object before class name
		atom.
    runtime mixing of mixins
		This would save you from having to create a class that just
		combined a few parent classes.  Instead you could create an
		instance of a set of classes, where the instance combined
		the features of these classes.

/****************************************************************
		       Class Definition Syntax

$$ /<%%>/{\\bf %}/

 A class is defined with the following syntax:

/****************************************************************

		    Information Kept About Classes

This package maintains information about each class and method
compiled.  This information is intended to be used later to compile
other classes, but can also be used as part of a development system or
other application that needs information about the known classes.

/*================================================================

			Predicates Maintained

The following predicates (in module obj_decl) are generated by this
package to keep track of the classes and methods that have been
defined.

++description
    class_size(Class, Size, Prefixsize)
	instances of Class are Size bytes + a Prefixsize byte header.

    class_file(Class, Filename)
	Class is defined in file Filename.

    term_class(Class, Term, Goal, Essence)
	Class is a term class whose instances are represented by
	terms that unify with Term and satisfy Goal.  Essence is a
	list of Variable:Type terms, where each Variable appears in
	Term, and each Type is the type of that variable.  If Essence
	is [], then each variable in Term is assumed to be a general
	term.

    subclass(Parent, Child)
	Child is a subclass of Parent.

    superclass(Child, Parent, Offset)
	Parent is a superclass of Child.  Parent's slots begin Offset bytes
	from the beginning of Child.

    direct_slot(Class, Slot, Type, Offset, Attribs)
	Slot is a direct (not inherited) slot of Class.  Contents of Slot
	are a descendent of Type, and can be found at Offset words from the
	beginning of an instance of Class.  Attribs is an extensible list of
	attributes of this slot.

    direct_message(Class, Messagename, Arity, Op)
	Messagename and Arity specify a direct (not inherited) message of
	Class, and Op is '<-', '>>', or '<<' specifying what kind of
	message.

    instance_method(Messagename, Arity, Class, Predname)
	Messagename and Arity specify a message which has been declared to
	be an instance method for Class.  Instance methods are always for
	the <- operator.  Predname is the name of the dynamic predicate
	that implements this method for this class.

    class_message(Class, Messagename, Arity, Op)
	Messagename and Arity specify a message which has been declared to
	be a class method for Class.  Methods are by default class methods,
	so this fact is only needed for a message which is declared to be an
	instance methods for some class, but class method for some
	descendant class.

    inherit_from(Class, Messagename, Arity, Op, Parent)
	The user has declared that Class should inherit message
	Messagename/Arity (of type Op) from Parent, which is one of
	Class's superclasses.

    uninherit_from(Class, Messagename, Arity, Op, Parent)
	The user has declared that Class should *not* inherit message
	Messagename/Arity (of type Op) from Parent, which is one of
	Class's superclasses, or is unbound.

    inline_method(Name, Arity, Class, Self, Op, Message, Body)
	The message Name/Arity (of type Op) is defined directly for Class as
	in inline method.  Message is the method head, and Body implements
	the method, where Self is the message recipient.

--description

Internally, this package maintains dynamic versions of all these preds, too,
which have the same name, with 'dyn_' on the front.  These are needed
because when compiling a file with qpc, clauses emitted earlier during
the compilation of the file are not available to be called when
compiling later parts of the file.  The 'dyn_' versions of these
predicates are retracted after the file is compiled.

There is also a version of each of these predicates for internal use
that checks both the dynamic and static versions, which has the same
name, but 'x_' prepended.

			  Modules Maintained

Modules involved in this package:

++description

    objects	Defines predicates needed at runtime to use the
		class package facilities.

    obj_decl	(this module).  Contains code needed to compile
		class definitions and also to optimize all message
		sends.  Also defines needed operators.  This file
		should be loaded with
++verbatim
	:- load_files(library(obj_decl),
		[when(compile_time), if(changed)]).
--verbatim
		by any file that uses the objects package.  This module
		also contains clauses describing the classes that
		have been defined.

    class_message_clauses
		Contains all the clauses that connect a message with
		the methods, the code that implements them.  Each
		clause in the module is of the form:
++verbatim
	'<-msg'(cls(_),Ob,A,B,C,...) :-
		class_method_clauses:'anc<-msg'(A,Ob,Offset,B,C,...).
--verbatim
		where msg is any message, cls is any class that
		understands that message, anc is the ancestor of cls
		that cls inherits msg from, and '<-' is the message
		operator.  A, B, C, ...  are the arguments of message
		msg, and Ob is used to pass the (Self) object, which
		is the same as the first argument to msg, to the
		method without having to reconstruct it on the heap.
		Offset is the offset within cls at which anc's slots
		can be found.  This offset is used by the method if it
		needs to access the object's slots.  Note that the
		rather strange argument ordering and shuffling is done
		to take advantage of indexing and minimize argument
		movement, avoiding extra instructions.

                Also included in this module is a clause of the form
++verbatim
        '<-'(msg(A,B,C,...),Obj) :-
                '<-msg'(Obj,Obj,A,B,C,...).
--verbatim
                Note that this is version of the predicate '<-'/2 (and
	        the other message operators) is not exported, and it has
	        its arguments reversed from what you would expect.  It is
	        called from the public version of '<-'/2 in classes.pl
	        and the arguments are reversed to allow indexing on the 
	        message term.  This predicate serves to speed up messages
	        in the case where the message is unknown (variable) at
	        compile time.

    class_method_clauses
		Contains all static method bodies.

    class_instance_method
		Contains all instance method bodies.

    class_instance_default
		Contains all default clauses for instance methods.
		These are actually static clauses.  We override the
		default clause(s) for a specific instance by
		asserta-ing a clause in class_instance_method that
		begins with a cut.  This means that the initial
		clauses for instance methods do not need to be copied
		for each new instance of a class.

    class_term_slots
		Contains all term slot contents, stored as binary
		dynamic predicates, with predicate name being the
		name of the dynamic slot, first (index) argument
		being the address of the object, and the second
		argument being the value.

/*================================================================

			   Ordinary Methods

The aim of this package is to give the greatest possible performance
with the least possible memory usage (of course).  For message
sending, the compromise chosen in this package is to have a predicate
for every message name/arity, which dispatches on the message
recipient's class, calling the predicate that implements that method.
Thus there is a predicate, called a linkage predicate, for each
message in the system, with a clause for each class which understands
this message.  There is also a predicate, called a method predicate,
for each distinct implementation of this message.  Thus if one class
defines a particular message, and many classes inherit it, there will
only be one copy of the code implementing this message.

For example, if class c defines a message m/2:
++verbatim
	Self <- m(X,Y) :-
		Self <- m1(X),
		Self <- m1(Y).
--verbatim
this clause would be compiled into the following method clause:
++verbatim
	class_method_clauses:'c<-m'(X,Self,_,Y) :-
		class_message_clauses:'<-m1'(Self,Self,X),
		class_message_clauses:'<-m1'(Self,Self,Y).
--verbatim

In addition, no matter how many clauses for this method are defined,
there will be two linkage clauses:
++verbatim
        class_message_clauses:'<-'(m(X,Y), Self) :-
	        class_message_clauses:'<-m'(Self, Self, X, Y).
	class_message_clauses:'<-m'(c(_), Self, X, Y) :-
		class_method_clauses:'c<-m'(X, Self, 0, Y).
--verbatim

*Self* is passed twice to class_message_clauses:m1/3 in the above code so
that it can be used for indexing to dispatch to the correct method,
without having to be reconstructed on the heap when it needed to be
passed to the actual method.  The rather strange argument ordering and
shuffling is done to minimize argument movement, avoiding extra
instructions.

The anonymous third argument in the head of the clause for
class_method_clauses:'c<-m'/4 is used to handle some subtle issues arising
from multiple inheritance.  This will be more fully described
elsewhere.

If sc is later defined as a subclass of c which does not shadow c's
definition of m/2, then we will also generate another clause for
class_message_clauses:'<-m'/4:

++verbatim
	class_message_clauses:'<-m'(sc(_), Self, X, Y) :-
		class_method_clauses:'c<-m'(X, Self, 0, Y).
--verbatim

			    Inline Methods

You may notice that if the method is quite simple, say a single goal,
then the linkage clause we go through to get to the method clause
is no bigger than the method clause itself.  It would be faster and
smaller if the linkage clause had the actual method inline, and we
never generated the method clause at all.  If there are many such
simple methods, as is typical of get and put methods, then this space
savings may be significant.

The choice of which methods are to be expanded inline like this is a
heuristic one.  In this implementation, I expand inline methods which
are implemented with a single clause containing no more than four
"cheap" builtin Prolog predicate calls and at most one call to a
non-builtin or non-cheap predicate.  Prolog builtins that are compiled
inline (i.e., without having to call a predicate) are considered
cheap.

/*****************************************************************

			   Instance Methods

One unusual feature of this package is the instance method.  An instance
method allows a class to have a different method for a particular
message for each instance.  That is, you can define the method for an
instance at runtime.  This is particularly useful for callbacks.  For
example, you might define a pushbutton class that will be sent a
pressed/0 message when the pushbutton is pressed.  If you make this an
instance method, you can have each individual pushbutton do something
different when the button is pressed.

You may also define a default method for this message, which will be
invoked if no method is defined for this message for this instance.
This is done simply by including some clauses for this method after
declaring it to be an instance method.  If no method is defined for an
instance, and no default method is defined, sending this method to that
instance simply fails.  Note that default methods are static procedures,
and so are quite efficient.  Also, they are not copied over as each
instance is created; instance methods do not make creating new instances
any less time or space efficient, though they do slow down destroying
instances a little.

A method for a particular class is declared to be an instance method
with a declaration within the definition of that class (i.e., between
the ':-class' declaration and the following ':-end_class' or the next
':-class' declaration).  The 'instance_method' declaration looks much
like a dynamic declaration:

++verbatim
	:- instance_method foo/4, bar/3, baz/2.
--verbatim

In the context of a declaration of class C, this declares that the
foo/4, bar/3 and baz/2 methods of each instance of class C are separate
dynamic procedures.  Any method defintions for these messages appearing
later in the definition of class C will be the default methods for each
newly created instance of class C.  That method can be replaced on a
per-instance basis.

Descendant classes of this class will inherit the fact that these
methods are instance_methods, as well as inheriting the default methods.
If a descendant class defines a different method for this message, it
will override (shadow) the default method of the ancestor class, but it
will still be an instance method.  If you wish a descendant class to
have this message be an ordinary class method, you must declare it to be
so:

++verbatim
	:- class_method foo/4, bar/3, baz/2.
--verbatim

Naturally, class methods are not as efficient as static methods, but the
performance penalty is not prohibitive.

****************************************************************/

/*================================================================

				Implementation

Instance methods are implemented a bit differently than ordinary methods.
A instance method fred/2 invoked by
++verbatim
	X <- fred(a,b)
--verbatim
is turned into the call
++verbatim
	class_message_clauses:'<-fred'(X,X,a,b)
--verbatim
by the usual expansion code.  This is just what would happen if fred/2
were not an instance method; it must be the same since we don't know
what the class of X is, so we don't know if fred/2 is an instance
method for that class or not.

We do generate a different linkage clause for instance methods.  For
fred/2 and class cl, we would generate
++verbatim
	class_message_clauses:'<-fred'(cl(Addr),Self,X,Y) :-
		class_instance_method:'<-fred'(Addr,Self,X,Y).
--verbatim
For a descendant class des, we would generate another identical
clause, except that cl would be replaced with des in both places.

Once for each declaration of fred/2 to be an instance method, we also
generate the clauses
++verbatim
	class_instance_method:'<-fred'(_,Self,X,Y) :-
		!,
		class_instance_default:'<-fred'(Self,Self,X,Y).

	class_instance_default:'<-fred'(0_,_,_) :- !, fail.
--verbatim
The latter clause is there just so that class_instance_default:fred/4
is sure to be defined, so there will be no undefined warnings or
errors.  Note that the 0 argument falls where an object must
appear, so this clause will never be reached.

When clauses for fred/2 in class cl are defined, they will be turned
into clauses for class_instance_default:'<-fred'/4 where the first
argument is cl(_).

When a method for fred/2 is defined at runtime for a particular
instance, we asserta a clause for class_instance_method:'<-fred'/4:
++verbatim
	class_instance_method:fred(Address,_,X,Y) :- !, Body
--verbatim
where Body is the processed body of the instance method being
established and Address is the address of the object whose instance
method for foo/2 is Body.  The body is processed to expand message
goals and calls to fetch_slot/2 and store_slot/2.

			      Debugging

The code generated by this package for sending messages is very
efficient, but this price of this is that sending an unknown message
to an object will just quietly fail.  This can make it very difficult
to track down errors in your code.  Unfortunately, getting around this
problem slows down message sending considerably.

The compromise adopted by this package is to allow users to indicate
whether or not they want to debug the messages sent in this file, or
in part of it, but including a
++verbatim
	:- debug_message.
--verbatim
directive in their file to indicate that messages appearing below in
the file should be debuggable (i.e., they should raise an exception if
they are not defined for the object to which they are sent, rather
than just failing), until the next
++verbatim
	:- nodebug_message.
--verbatim
directive.  These directives may be nested, however, debug mode is
turned off at the end of a file.

			    Extensibility

This package allows itself to be extended in numerous ways.  This
makes it possible for users to go beyond defining new classes with
this package by defining new *kinds* of objects, new attributes for
slots, etc.  You can extend the syntax of class declarations.

These sorts of extensions are made by supplying new clauses for
certain multifile predicates defined and called by this package.  The
following predicates, all defined in module 'obj_decl', may be
extended:
