%% Blackboard entries:
%%   installed_breakpoints - list of main advice point IDs
%%   fdbg_logfile          - the stream used for logging
%%   constraint_hook       - the hook(s) to be called on dispatch_global/4 exit
%%   labeling_hook         - the hook(s) to be called on labeling events
%%   fdvar_counter         - the number of the next auto-named variable
%%
%% Options:
%%
%%   Output redirection:
%%
%%   * file(Filename, Mode) - Tells FDBG to set the stream alias 'fdbg_output'
%%	to the file called Filename opened in mode Mode.  Mode can either
%%	be 'write' or 'append'.  The file specified is opened on a call to
%%	fdbg_on/1 and is closed on a call to fdbg_off/0.  The built-in 
%%	visualizer dumps it's output to this stream and it's advisable for any
%%	user written visualizers to do the same.
%%   * socket(Host, Port) - Same as the file option, but it tells FDBG to 
%%      set the stream alias 'fdbg_output' to the _socket_ connected to
%%      Host on port Port.  The specified socket is created on a call to
%%      fdbg_on/1 and is closed on a call to fdbg_off/0.
%%   * stream(StreamOrAlias) - Tells FDBG to set the stream alias 'fdbg_output'
%%      to the given stream or stream alias.
%%
%%     If none of the three output-specification options (file, socket or
%%     stream) is given in the option list, then the default behaviour is to
%%     set the 'fdbg_output' alias to the current output stream.
%%
%%   Global constraint events:
%%
%%   * constraint_hook(Goal) - Tells FDBG to extend Goal with two (additional) 
%%	arguments and call it on the exit port of the global constraint 
%%	dispatcher.  The two arguments are the following:
%%	  - Constraint: the constraint that was handled by the dispatcher
%%	  - Actions:    the action list returned by the dispatcher
%%	Goal should normally be a visualizer, either built-in (see fdbg_show/3)
%%	or user defined.  Several 'constraint_hook' options may appear in the
%%	option list, they will be called in their order of appearence.
%%   * no_constraint_hook - Tells FDBG not to call any visulaizer for global
%%     constraint events.
%%
%%     If none of these options is given then the default constraint
%%     visualizer, fdbg_show/3 is used.
%%
%%   Labeling events:
%%
%%   * labeling_hook(Goal) - Tells FDBG to extend Goal with three (additional)
%%      arguments and call it on any of the following labeling events:
%%        - start:      labeling has just started for a variable
%%        - fail:       labeling has just failed for a variable
%%        - step(Step): variable has been constrained in a labeling step,
%%                       which is described by the compound term Step
%%      The three arguments are the following:
%%        - Event: one of the atoms above
%%        - ID:    identifies the labeling session, i.e. binds step and
%%                 fail events to the corresponding start event
%%        - Var:   the variable being the subject of labeling
%%   * no_labeling_hook - Tells FDBG not to call any visulaizer for labeling
%%      events.
%%
%%     If none of these options is given then the default labeling
%%     visualizer, fdbg_label_show/3 is used.

%% The first clause here overrides the default handling of the & debugger
%% command (when fdbg is loaded), so that the annotated form of FD variables
%% is also printed when listing the variables with blocked goals.
%%
%% The second clause defines the 'A' debugger command to annotate and
%% print the current goal, and print a legend of the variables appearing
%% in it.  If a selector is specified then the subterm specified by it in
%% the current goal is assumed to be an action list, and is taken into
%% account when displaying the legend.  For example at the exit port of
%% dispatch_global/4 the debugger command "A [4]" would use the action
%% list returned by the current constraint (in the fourth argument).
%%
