%@  @cindex attributed variables
%@  @cindex variables, attributed
%@  This package implements attributed variables.  It provides a means
%@  of associating with variables arbitrary attributes, i.e.@: named
%@  properties that can be used as storage locations as well as to extend
%@  the default unification algorithm when such variables are
%@  unified with other terms or with each other.  This facility
%@  was primarily designed as a clean interface between Prolog and
%@  constraint solvers, but has a number of other uses as well.  The basic
%@  idea is due to Christian Holzbaur and he was actively involved in the
%@  final design.  For background material, see the dissertation [Holzbaur 90].
%@  
%@  The package provides a means to declare and access named attributes of
%@  variables.  The attributes are compound terms whose
%@  arguments are the actual attribute values.  The attribute names
%@  are @emph{private} to the module in which they are defined.  They
%@  are defined with a declaration
%@  
%@  @cindex attribute declaration
%@  @cindex declaration, attribute
%@  @PLXindex {attribute/1 (declaration)}
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  :- attribute @var{AttributeSpec}, @dots{}, @var{AttributeSpec}.
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  @noindent
%@  where each @var{AttributeSpec} has the form (@var{Name}/@var{Arity}).
%@  There must be at most one such declaration in a module
%@  @var{Module}.
%@  
%@  Having declared some attribute names, these attributes can now be added,
%@  updated and deleted from unbound variables.  For each
%@  declared attribute name, any variable can have at most one such
%@  attribute (initially it has none).
%@  
%@  The declaration causes the following two access predicates
%@  to become defined by means of the @code{goal_expansion/5}
%@  mechanism.  They take a variable and an @var{AccessSpec} as
%@  arguments where an @var{AccessSpec} is either
%@  @code{+(@var{Attribute})}, @code{-(@var{Attribute})}, or a list of
%@  such.  The @samp{+} prefix may be dropped for convenience.  The meaning
%@  of the @samp{+}/@samp{-} prefix is documented below:
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @PLXindex {get_atts/2 (Module)}
%@  @item @var{Module}:get_atts(@var{-Var}, @var{?AccessSpec})
%@  Gets the attributes of @var{Var} according to @var{AccessSpec}.  If
%@  @var{AccessSpec} is unbound, it will be bound to a
%@  list of all set attributes of @var{Var}.  Non-variable
%@  terms cause a type error to be raised.  The prefixes in the
%@  @var{AccessSpec} have the following meaning:
%@  @table @code
%@  @item +(@var{Attribute})
%@  The corresponding actual attribute must be present and is unified with
%@  @var{Attribute}.
%@  
%@  @item -(@var{Attribute})
%@  The corresponding actual attribute must be absent.  The arguments
%@  of @var{Attribute} are ignored, only the name and arity are
%@  relevant.
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  @PLXindex {put_atts/2 (Module)}
%@  @item @var{Module}:put_atts(@var{-Var}, @var{+AccessSpec})
%@  Sets the attributes of @var{Var} according to @var{AccessSpec}.
%@  Non-variable terms cause a type error to be raised.  The
%@  effects of @code{put_atts/2} are undone on backtracking.
%@  @table @code
%@  @item +(@var{Attribute})
%@  The corresponding actual attribute is set to @var{Attribute}.
%@  If the actual attribute was already present, it is simply replaced.
%@  
%@  @item -(@var{Attribute})
%@  The corresponding actual attribute is removed.
%@  If the actual attribute was already absent, nothing happens.
%@  @end table
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  A module that contains an attribute declaration has an
%@  opportunity to extend the default unification algorithm by
%@  defining the following predicate:
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @PLXindex {verify_attributes/3 (Module)}
%@  @item @var{Module}:verify_attributes(@var{-Var}, @var{+Value}, @var{-Goals}) @value{sphfill} @dfn{hook}
%@  This predicate is called whenever a variable @var{Var} that
%@  might have attributes in @var{Module} is about to be bound to
%@  @var{Value} (it might have none).  The unification resumes after
%@  the call to @code{verify_attributes/3}.  @var{Value} is a
%@  non-variable term, or another attributed variable.
%@  @var{Var} might have no attributes present in @var{Module}; the
%@  unification extension mechanism is not sophisticated enough to
%@  filter out exactly the variables that are relevant for
%@  @var{Module}.
%@  
%@  @code{verify_attributes/3} is called @emph{before} @var{Var} has
%@  actually been bound to @var{Value}.  If it fails, the
%@  unification is deemed to have failed.  It may succeed
%@  nondeterminately, in which case the unification might
%@  backtrack to give another answer.  It is expected to return, in
%@  @var{Goals}, a list of goals to be called @emph{after}
%@  @var{Var} has been bound to @var{Value}.  Finally, after calling
%@  @var{Goals}, any goals blocked on @var{Var} are called.
%@  
%@  @code{verify_attributes/3} may invoke arbitrary Prolog goals, but
%@  @var{Var} should @emph{not} be bound by it.  Binding
%@  @var{Var} will result in undefined behavior.
%@  
%@  If @var{Value} is a non-variable term,
%@  @code{verify_attributes/3} will typically inspect the attributes of
%@  @var{Var} and check that they are compatible with @var{Value} and fail
%@  otherwise.  If @var{Value} is another attributed variable,
%@  @code{verify_attributes/3} will typically copy the attributes of
%@  @var{Var} over to @var{Value}, or merge them with @var{Value}'s, in
%@  preparation for @var{Var} to be bound to @var{Value}.  In either
%@  case, @code{verify_attributes/3} may determine @var{Var}'s current
%@  attributes by calling @code{get_atts(@var{Var},@var{List})} with an
%@  unbound @var{List}.
%@  
%@  In the case when a single unification binds multiple attributed
%@  variables, first all such bindings are @emph{undone}, then 
%@  the following actions are carried out for each relevant variable:
%@  
%@  @enumerate
%@  @item
%@  For each relevant module @var{M}, @code{@var{M}:verify_attributes/3}
%@  is called, collecting a list of returned @var{Goals}.
%@  @item
%@  The variable binding is @emph{redone}.
%@  @item
%@  Any @var{Goals} are called.
%@  @item
%@  Any blocked goals are called.
%@  @end enumerate
%@  
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  An important use for attributed variables is in implementing
%@  coroutining facilities as an alternative or complement to the
%@  built-in coroutining mechanisms.  In this context it might be
%@  useful to be able to interpret some of the attributes of a
%@  variable as a goal that is blocked on that
%@  variable.  Certain built-in predicates (@code{frozen/2},
%@  @code{copy_term/3}) and the Prolog top-level need to access
%@  blocked goals, and so need a means of getting the goal
%@  interpretation of attributed variables by calling:
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @PLXindex {attribute_goal/2 (Module)}
%@  @item @var{Module}:attribute_goal(@var{-Var}, @var{-Goal}) @value{sphfill} @dfn{hook}
%@  This predicate is called in each module that contains an
%@  attribute declaration, when an interpretation of the attributes as
%@  a goal is needed, in particular in @code{frozen/2},
%@  @code{copy_term/3} and the Prolog top-level.
%@  It should unify @var{Goal} with the
%@  interpretation, or merely fail if no such interpretation is available.
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  An important use for attributed variables is to provide an
%@  interface to constraint solvers.  An important function for a constraint
%@  solver in the constraint logic programming paradigm is to be able to
%@  perform projection of the residual constraints onto the variables
%@  that occurred in the top-level query.  A module that
%@  contains an attribute declaration has an opportunity to perform
%@  such projection of its residual constraints by defining the following
%@  predicate:
%@  
%@  @table @code
%@  @PLXindex {project_attributes/2 (Module)}
%@  @item @var{Module}:project_attributes(@var{+QueryVars}, @var{+AttrVars}) @value{sphfill} @dfn{hook}
%@  This predicate is called by the Prolog top level in each module that
%@  contains an attribute declaration.  @var{QueryVars} is the
%@  list of variables occurring in the query, or in
%@  terms bound to such variables, and @var{AttrVars} is a
%@  list of possibly attributed variables created during the
%@  execution of the query.  The two lists of variables
%@  may or may not be disjoint.
%@  
%@  If the attributes on @var{AttrVars} can be interpreted as constraints,
%@  this predicate will typically ``project'' those constraints onto
%@  the relevant @var{QueryVars}.  Ideally, the residual constraints will be
%@  expressed entirely in terms of the @var{QueryVars}, treating all
%@  other variables as existentially quantified.  Operationally,
%@  @code{project_attributes/2} must remove all attributes from
%@  @var{AttrVars}, and add transformed attributes representing the
%@  projected constraints to some of the @var{QueryVars}.
%@  
%@  Projection has the following effect on the Prolog top-level.  When the
%@  top-level query has succeeded, @code{project_attributes/2} is
%@  called first.  The top-level then prints the answer substition and
%@  residual constraints.  While doing so, it searches for attributed
%@  variables created during the execution of the query.  For
%@  each such variable, it calls @code{attribute_goal/2} to get a
%@  printable representation of the constraint encoded by the attribute.
%@  Thus, @code{project_attributes/2} is a mechanism for controlling how the
%@  residual constraints should be displayed at top-level.
%@  
%@  The exact definition of @code{project_attributes/2} is constraint system
%@  dependent, but @pxref{Answer Constraints} and @pxref{CLPQR Projection}
%@  for details about projection in CLPFD and CLP(Q,R) respectively.
%@  @end table
%@  
%@  In the following example we sketch the implementation of a finite domain
%@  ``solver''.  Note that an industrial strength solver would have to
%@  provide a wider range of functionality and that it quite likely would
%@  utilize a more efficient representation for the domains proper.  The
%@  module exports a single predicate
%@  @code{domain(@var{-Var},@var{?Domain})}, which associates @var{Domain}
%@  (a list of terms) with @var{Var}.  A variable can be
%@  queried for its domain by leaving @var{Domain} unbound.
%@  
%@  We do not present here a 
%@  definition for @code{project_attributes/2}.  Projecting finite domain
%@  constraints happens to be difficult.
%@  
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  @flushright
%@  @emph{% domain.pl}
%@  @end flushright
%@  :- module(domain, [domain/2]).
%@  
%@  :- use_module(library(atts)).

%@     ]).
%@  
%@  :- attribute dom/1.
%@  
%@  verify_attributes(Var, Other, Goals) :-
%@          get_atts(Var, dom(Da)), !,          % are we involved?
%@          (   var(Other) ->                   % must be attributed then

%@                  ord_intersection(Da, Db, Dc),
%@                  Dc = [El|Els],              % at least one element
%@                  (   Els = [] ->             % exactly one element
%@                      Goals = [Other=El]      % implied binding

%@  
%@  attribute_goal(Var, domain(Var,Dom)) :-     % interpretation as goal
%@          get_atts(Var, dom(Dom)).
%@  
%@  domain(X, Dom) :-
%@          var(Dom), !,
%@          get_atts(X, dom(Dom)).
%@  domain(X, List) :-
%@          list_to_ord_set(List, Set),
%@          Set = [El|Els],                     % at least one element

%@              X = Fresh                       % may call

%@          ).
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  Note that the ``implied binding'' @code{Other=El} was deferred until
%@  after the completion of @code{verify_attribute/3}.  Otherwise, there
%@  might be a danger of recursively invoke @code{verify_attribute/3}, which
%@  might bind @code{Var}, which is not allowed inside the scope of
%@  @code{verify_attribute/3}.  Deferring unifications into the third
%@  argument of @code{verify_attribute/3} effectively serializes th
%@  calls to @code{verify_attribute/3}.
%@  
%@  Assuming that the code resides in the file @file{domain.pl}, we can
%@  load it via:
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  | ?- @kbd{use_module(domain).}
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  Let's test it:
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  | ?- @kbd{domain(X,[5,6,7,1]), domain(Y,[3,4,5,6]), domain(Z,[1,6,7,8]).}
%@  
%@  domain(X,[1,5,6,7]),
%@  domain(Y,[3,4,5,6]),
%@  domain(Z,[1,6,7,8])
%@  
%@  | ?- @kbd{domain(X,[5,6,7,1]), domain(Y,[3,4,5,6]), domain(Z,[1,6,7,8]), }
%@       @kbd{X=Y.}
%@  
%@  Y = X,
%@  domain(X,[5,6]),
%@  domain(Z,[1,6,7,8])
%@  
%@  | ?- @kbd{domain(X,[5,6,7,1]), domain(Y,[3,4,5,6]), domain(Z,[1,6,7,8]),}
%@       @kbd{X=Y, Y=Z.}
%@  
%@  X = 6,
%@  Y = 6,
%@  Z = 6
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  To demonstrate the use of the @var{Goals} argument of
%@  @code{verify_attributes/3}, we give an implementation of
%@  @code{freeze/2}.  We have to name it @code{myfreeze/2} in order to avoid
%@  a name clash with the built-in predicate of the same name.
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  @flushright
%@  @emph{% myfreeze.pl}
%@  @end flushright
%@  :- module(myfreeze, [myfreeze/2]).
%@  
%@  :- use_module(library(atts)).
%@  
%@  :- attribute frozen/1.
%@  
%@  verify_attributes(Var, Other, Goals) :-
%@          get_atts(Var, frozen(Fa)), !,       % are we involved?
%@          (   var(Other) ->                   % must be attributed then
%@              (   get_atts(Other, frozen(Fb)) % has a pending goal?
%@              ->  put_atts(Other, frozen((Fa,Fb))) % rescue conjunction
%@              ;   put_atts(Other, frozen(Fa)) % rescue the pending goal
%@              ),
%@              Goals = []
%@          ;   Goals = [Fa]
%@          ).
%@  verify_attributes(_, _, []).
%@  
%@  attribute_goal(Var, Goal) :-                % interpretation as goal
%@          get_atts(Var, frozen(Goal)).
%@  
%@  myfreeze(X, Goal) :-
%@          put_atts(Fresh, frozen(Goal)),
%@          Fresh = X.
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  Assuming that this code lives in file @file{myfreeze.pl},
%@  we would use it via:
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  | ?- @kbd{use_module(myfreeze).}
%@  | ?- @kbd{myfreeze(X,print(bound(x,X))), X=2.}
%@  
%@  bound(x,2)                      % side-effect
%@  X = 2                           % bindings
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  The two solvers even work together:
%@  
%@  @example
%@  @group
%@  | ?- @kbd{myfreeze(X,print(bound(x,X))), domain(X,[1,2,3]),}
%@       @kbd{domain(Y,[2,10]), X=Y.}
%@  
%@  bound(x,2)                      % side-effect
%@  X = 2,                          % bindings
%@  Y = 2
%@  @end group
%@  @end example
%@  
%@  The two example solvers interact via bindings to shared attributed
%@  variables only.  More complicated interactions are likely to be
%@  found in more sophisticated solvers.  The corresponding
%@  @code{verify_attributes/3} predicates would typically refer to the
%@  attributes from other known solvers/modules via the module
%@  prefix in @code{@var{Module}:get_atts/2}.
