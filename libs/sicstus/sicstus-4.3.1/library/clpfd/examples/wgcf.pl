% The wolf, goat, cabbage problem
%
% A farmer has to take a wolf, goat and cabbage across a bridge
% He can only take one thing at a time
% The wolf and goat can't be left together alone (without the farmer)
% The goat and cabbage can't be left alone together

% 1..3 represent the three locations:
% 1 is on the left bank of the river
% 2 is on the bridge
% 3 is on the right bank

	    % All start on the right bank and finish on the left bank
	    % Things can only move from bank to bridge, or from bridge to bank, in one step
	    % The wolf can be on the bridge only if:
	    % (b) The farmer was previously on the same bank as the wolf
	    % (c) The farmer goes subsequently to the same bank as the wolf
