<h3 class="section">3.2 Platform Specific Notes</h3>

<p>This section contains some installation notes that are platform
specific under UNIX.

     <dl>
<!-- [PM] 4.3 Solaris 8 is no longer supported -->
<!-- @item Solaris 8 SPARC 64-bit -->
<!-- You cannot install (or build) the 64 bit version of SICStus using -->
<!-- @command{gcc 2.x}. You need to use the Sun Workshop compiler, -->
<!-- version 5.0 or later. @code{InstallSICStus} will try to find it during -->
<!-- installation but if that fails, you can set the environment variable -->
<!-- @env{CC} to e.g.@: @file{/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc} before invoking -->
<!-- @code{InstallSICStus}. Recent versions of gcc, i.e.@: gcc 3.x or 4.x, -->
<!-- do seem to work. -->
<!-- To install with @command{gcc}, -->
<!-- set the environment variable @env{CC} appropriately before invoking -->
<!-- @code{InstallSICStus}. -->

     <dt><strong>Solaris Intel 64-bit, SPARC 64-bit</strong><dd>
The following libraries are not supported: <code>library(bdb)</code>,
<code>library(tcltk)</code>.

     <!-- [PM] 4.3 Solaris 8 is no longer supported -->
     <!-- @item Solaris 8 -->
     <!-- The default thread library in Solaris 8 is incompatible with -->
     <!-- SICStus.  The ``Alternate Thread Library (T2)'' must be used instead.  This is -->
     <!-- ensured automatically for executables built with the @command{spld} -->
     <!-- tool.  It is @strong{not} ensured automatically when loading SICStus -->
     <!-- into Java or other programs not built by @command{spld}. See -->
     <!-- @uref{http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/alt_thread_lib.html} -->
     <!-- for further information. -->
     <!-- Problems caused by the old thread library include: -->
     <!-- @itemize @bullet -->
     <!-- @item -->
     <!-- @code{library(timeout)} does not work. -->
     <!-- @item -->
     <!-- Java hangs during initialization of a Jasper @code{SICStus} object. -->
     <!-- @end itemize -->
     <!-- This problem does not affect Solaris 9 or later. -->
     <!-- @ifset MACOSXSUPPORTED -->
     <br><dt><strong>Mac OS X</strong><dd>
Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.8 are supported on Intel 32-bit and
64-bit. Mac OS X 10.6 or later is recommended, due to deficiencies in Mac OS X
10.5 that affects the SICStus I/O sub-system.

     <p>An executable built with <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> will only work if there is a
properly configured subdirectory <samp><span class="file">sp-4.3.1</span></samp> in the
same directory as the executable; see <a href="../sicstus/Runtime-Systems-on-UNIX-Target-Machines.html#Runtime-Systems-on-UNIX-Target-Machines">Runtime Systems on UNIX Target Machines</a>.

     <p>Alternatively, the option <samp><span class="option">--wrapper</span></samp> can be passed to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp>. 
In this case a wrapper script is created that will set up various
environment variables and invoke the real executable.

     <p>When using third-party products like BDB, you may need to set up
<samp><span class="env">DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> so that the Mac OS X dynamic linker can find
them. When using the SICStus development executable (<samp><span class="command">sicstus</span></samp>),
this should happen automatically, if the third-party products have been
installed in the standard locations; see <a href="Berkeley-DB-on-Mac-OS-X.html#Berkeley-DB-on-Mac-OS-X">Berkeley DB on Mac OS X</a>.

     <p>Sometimes, the default limit on the process's data-segment is
unreasonably small, which may lead to unexpected memory allocation
failures. To check this limit, do:
     <pre class="example">          bash$ <kbd>ulimit -d</kbd>
          6144
</pre>
     <p>This indicates that the maximum size of the data-segment is only 6
Mb. To remove the limit, do:
     <pre class="example">          bash$ <kbd>ulimit -d unlimited</kbd>
          bash$ <kbd>ulimit -d</kbd>
          unlimited
</pre>
     <blockquote>
<strong>Please note</strong>: <samp><span class="command">ulimit</span></samp> is a shell built-in
in <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>. It may have a different name in other shells. 
</blockquote>

     <!-- [PM] 4.2 Emacs now passes -DSP_ULIMIT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE=unlimited -->
     <!-- @quotation -->
     <!-- @strong{Please note}: The limit will also affect SICStus when started -->
     <!-- from within Emacs, e.g.@: with @kbd{M-x run-prolog}. To change the -->
     <!-- limit used by Emacs and its sub-processes (such as SICStus) you will -->
     <!-- need to change the limit in the shell used to start Emacs. Alternatively -->
     <!-- you can create a shell wrapper for the @command{emacs} command. -->
     <!-- @end quotation -->
     <p>SICStus will set the data segment size of itself according to the representation
of the system property (or environment variable)
<samp><span class="env">SP_ULIMIT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE</span></samp>. If you set this variable in the
initialization file for your shell you don't have to use the
<samp><span class="command">ulimit</span></samp> command when SICStus is started from the
shell. See <a href="../sicstus/System-Properties-and-Environment-Variables.html#System-Properties-and-Environment-Variables">System Properties and Environment Variables</a> for more information about
<samp><span class="env">SP_ULIMIT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE</span></samp>. This system property is set
automatically when SICStus is invoked from the SICStus Prolog IDE
(SPIDER), from Emacs (via <kbd>M-x run-prolog</kbd>), or from the launcher
script <samp><span class="file">SICStus Prolog 4.3.1.term</span></samp> installed in
<samp><span class="file">Applications</span></samp>.

     <p>File names are encoded in UTF-8 under Mac OS X. This is
handled correctly by SICStus.

     <p>If SICStus encounters a file name that is not encoded in UTF-8, it
<!-- will interpret the name as @w{Latin 1} (ISO-8859-1) instead. -->
will silently ignore the file or directory. 
This can happen on file systems where files have been created by some
other OS than Mac OS X, e.g. on network file servers accessed by
other UNIX flavors or Windows.

     <p>The default character encoding for the SICStus standard streams is
based on the current locale which is POSIX/C, i.e. US ASCII, by
default on Mac OS X. 
<!-- (@pxref{WCX Environment Variables, , WCX Environment Variables, sicstus, the SICStus Prolog Manual}). -->
This will come in
conflict with the default character encoding for the Terminal
application which is UTF-8. A clickable launcher for SICStus is
optionally installed in the Applications folder. This launcher will set
the character encoding of the standard streams to UTF-8 for both the
Terminal and SICStus. The character encoding is set automatically when
SICStus is invoked from the SICStus Prolog IDE (SPIDER), or from Emacs
(via <kbd>M-x run-prolog</kbd>)

     <!-- @end ifset MACOSXSUPPORTED -->
     <!-- [PM] 4.1.0 Seems to be fixed in 10.6 (but our code has not yet adapted). -->
     <!-- On Mac OS X some I/O operation can cause SICStus to hang in a way that -->
     <!-- cannot be interrupted with @kbd{C-c} (@code{SIGINT}). The cause of this -->
     <!-- is that, despite the UNIX 03 certification of Mac OS X 10.5, Mac OS X -->
     <!-- does not implement cancellable I/O. -->
     <!-- @item @strong{irix} -->
     <!-- @code{spld -moveable} implies @option{-wrapper}. this is due to -->
     <!-- limitations in the irix runtime loader. -->
     <!-- @item @strong{irix} -->
     <!-- prelinked dynamic resources will not be found at runtime if the -->
     <!-- executable was built with @code{spld -moveable}. this should not be a -->
     <!-- problem; prelinked dynamic resources are not recommended anyway. -->
     <!-- [PM] 4.1.0 AIX no longer supported -->
