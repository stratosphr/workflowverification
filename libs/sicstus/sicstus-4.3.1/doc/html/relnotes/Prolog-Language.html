<h4 class="subsection">13.1.2 Prolog Language</h4>

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.1 Single Language Mode</h5>

<p>Release 3 had the notion of multiple language modes: <code>iso</code> and
<code>sicstus</code>.  Release 4 does not have this notion.  The syntax and
semantics of the Prolog language correspond to the previous
<code>iso</code> language mode.

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.2 DCG Notation</h5>

<p>The exact rules for translating DCG rules to plain Prolog clauses have
not been laid down in a standard, but there is a broad consensus in
the Prolog community about what they should mean.  One of the guiding
principles is that the translation should be steadfast, in particular
that the translated code should always treat its last argument as an
output argument and not use it &ldquo;too early&rdquo;. In some cases, a
non-steadfast translation was produced in release 3.  This has been
corrected in release 4.

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.3 Asserting Terms with Attributed Variables</h5>

<p>In release 3, terms containing attributed variables and blocked goals
could be asserted, copied, gathered as solutions to <code>findall/3</code>
and friends, and raised as exceptions.  The copy would contain new
attributed variables with the attributes copied.  This operation could
be very expensive, could yield unexpected results and was not always
safe e.g. in the context of CLPFD constraints.  In release 4, the
semantics of this operation has changed: in the copy, an attributed
variable is simply replaced by a plain, brand new variable.  Of
course, if the same attributed variable occurs more than once, the
same plain variable will occur in the corresponding places in the
copy.  If the attributes are relevant, the program can obtain them by
using the new built-in predicate <code>copy_term/3</code> described below.

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.4 Arithmetic</h5>

<p>The infix operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; (bitwise exclusive or) has been renamed to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.5 Syntax</h5>

<p>Atoms can now contain the &lt;NUL&gt; character, i.e. character code
zero. It is classified as whitespace and must therefore be entered
using escapes. As an example <code>'a\0\a'</code> is a three character atom
containing two <code>a</code>s separated by a &lt;NUL&gt;.

   <p>Internally, atom names and other encoded strings, use the non-shortest
form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0xC0 0x80</span></samp>&rsquo; to encode &lt;NUL&gt;. This is similar to how &lt;NUL&gt;
is handled by Tcl/Tk and Java.

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.6 Prolog Flags</h5>

<p>The <code>language</code> and <code>wcx</code> Prolog flag have been dropped. 
The <code>profiledcode</code> representation of the <code>compiling</code> Prolog flag has been dropped.
Several new Prolog flags have been added. 
See <a href="../sicstus/ref_002dlps_002dflg.html#ref_002dlps_002dflg">Prolog Flags</a>.

<!-- [PM] 4.1.0 has become out-of-date -->
<!-- The following Prolog flag is new: -->
<!-- @table @code -->
<!-- @item quoted_charset -->
<!-- Controls the character set to use when writing quoted atoms. -->
<!-- @end table -->
<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.7 Stream Properties</h5>

<p>The <code>wcx</code> property has been dropped. 
Several new stream properties have been added. 
See <a href="../sicstus/mpg_002dref_002dstream_005fproperty.html#mpg_002dref_002dstream_005fproperty"><code>stream_property/2</code></a>.

<!-- [PM] 4.1.0 has become out-of-date -->
<!-- The following properties are new: -->
<!-- @table @code -->
<!-- @item encoding_signature/1 -->
<!-- Specifies whether an encoding signature (such as Unicode ``byte order -->
<!-- mark'') was used to determine the character encoding. -->
<!-- @item encoding/1 -->
<!-- Subsumes the @code{wcx/1} option of release 3. -->
<!-- @item eol/1 -->
<!-- Specifies how line endings in the file should be handled if the stream -->
<!-- is opened in text mode. -->
<!-- @end table -->
<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.8 Statistics Keywords</h5>

<p>Several new statistics keywords have been added. 
See <a href="../sicstus/mpg_002dref_002dstatistics.html#mpg_002dref_002dstatistics"><code>statistics/[0,1]</code></a>.

<!-- [PM] 4.1.0 has become out-of-date -->
<!-- The following keywords are new: -->
<!-- @table @code -->
<!-- @item total_runtime -->
<!-- Measures the total CPU time used while executing, including memory -->
<!-- management such as garbage collection but excluding system calls. -->
<!-- @item defragmentation -->
<!-- Measures the number of and time spent performing memory defragmentation. -->
<!-- @end table -->
<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.9 Built-In Predicates</h5>

<p>The set of built-in predicates has changed slightly.  The following
predicates have been removed:

     <dl>
<dt><code>'C'/3</code><dd>This was used in the Prolog translation of DCG rules.  It could
trivially be replaced by unifications and served no other reasonable
purpose.

     <br><dt><code>get0/[1,2]</code><dt><code>put/[1,2]</code><dd>These used to have an overloaded semantics meaning one thing on binary
streams and another thing on text streams.  They have been subsumed by
their ISO counterparts.

     <br><dt><code>get/[1,2]</code><dt><code>tab/[1,2]</code><dt><code>skip/[1,2]</code><dd>Although these don't have ISO counterparts, they have been removed
for being in the spirit of <code>get0/[1,2]</code> and <code>put/[1,2]</code>. 
We have provided <code>skip_char/[1,2]</code>, <code>skip_code/[1,2]</code>, and
<code>skip_byte/[1,2]</code> as an ISO style replacement for
<code>skip/[1,2]</code>.

     <br><dt><code>ttyget0/1</code><dt><code>ttyget/1</code><dt><code>ttynl/0</code><dt><code>ttyput/1</code><dt><code>ttyskip/1</code><dt><code>ttytab/1</code><dt><code>ttyflush/0</code><dd>These used to exist as shorthands for the respective predicate with an
additional <code>user</code> argument. In most cases, the &ldquo;respective
predicate&rdquo; is one of the non-ISO style predicate mentioned above, so
there was no point in keeping the shorthand.

     <br><dt><code>fileerrors/0</code><br><dt><code>nofileerrors/0</code><dd>These used to exist as shorthands for <code>set_prolog_flag/2</code> with
specific arguments, and so can be trivially replaced.

     <br><dt><code>call_residue/2</code><dd>Dropped because it was not possible to ensure the correct behavior in
all circumstances, it relied heavily on copying terms with attributed
variables, and it was not needed by any library module.  It has been
replaced by a similar predicate, <code>call_residue_vars/2</code>, which should
suffice in most cases where <code>call_residue/2</code> was used; see below.

     <br><dt><code>undo/1</code><dd>Dropped because it was not possible to ensure the correct behavior in
all circumstances. Users that know what they are doing can still call
the unsupported predicate <code>prolog:undo/1</code>. The argument should
have a module prefix.

     <br><dt><code>help/0</code><dt><code>version/0</code><dt><code>version/1</code><dd>These predicates, managing and displaying messages, can be easily
emulated by feaures of the message system.

     <br><dt><code>fcompile/1</code><dt><code>load/1</code><dd>These predicates used to compile Prolog source code into &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.ql</span></samp>&rsquo;
files, and load such files.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.ql</span></samp>&rsquo; files serve a purpose when
boot-strapping the Prolog system, but offer no advantages over
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.po</span></samp>&rsquo; files, the Prolog object code format used by other built-in
predicates.

     <br><dt><code>load_foreign_files/2</code><dd>This predicate provided a shorthand for building and loading a
temporary foreign resource.  Working with foreign resources is
straightforward, and so the shorthand was dropped.

     <br><dt><code>require/1</code><dd>This predicate provided a shorthand for locating and loading library
predicates.  This was originally introduced for a compatibility reason
that is now obsolete.  It is straightforward to provide the necessary
<code>:- use_module/2</code> directives, and so the shorthand was dropped.

     <br><dt><code>profile_data/4</code><dt><code>profile_reset/1</code><dd>As of release 4.2, the execution profiling technology has been
reengineered, eliminating the need to specially instrument code before
it could be profiled.  The new scheme also keeps track of the number of
calls per caller-callee pair.  Execution profiling is available for
compiled as well as interpreted code.  These two predicates have been
replaced by a small number of new ones.

   </dl>

   <p>The following predicates have been added:

     <dl>
<dt><code>call/</code><var>N</var><dd>Generalizes <code>call/1</code>.  For example, <code>call(p(1,2), a, b)</code> is
equivalent to <code>call(p(1,2, a, b))</code>.

     <br><dt><code>skip_char/[1,2]</code><dt><code>skip_code/[1,2]</code><dt><code>skip_byte/[1,2]</code><dd>ISO style replacements for the non-ISO style <code>skip/[1,2]</code>.

     <br><dt><code>call_residue_vars/2</code><dd>Called as follows:

     <pre class="example">          call_residue_vars(<var>:Goal</var>, <var>-Vars</var>)
</pre>
     <p>Executes the procedure call <var>Goal</var>, unifying <var>Vars</var> with
the list of residual variables that have blocked goals or attributes
attached to them.  <strong>Please note:</strong> behaves differently from
<code>call_residue/2</code> of release 3.

     <br><dt><code>copy_term/3</code><dd>Called as follows:

     <pre class="example">          copy_term(<var>+Term</var>, <var>-Copy</var>, <var>-Body</var>)
</pre>
     <p>Unifies <var>Copy</var> with a copy of <var>Term</var> in which all variables have
been replaced by brand new variables, and all mutables by brand new
mutables.  If <var>Term</var> contains variables with goals blocked on them,
or variables with attributes that can be interpreted as a goal
(see <a href="../sicstus/lib_002datts.html#lib_002datts"><code>library(atts)</code></a>), then <var>Body</var> is unified with the conjunction of
such goals.  If no such goals are present, <var>Body</var> is unified with
the atom <code>true</code>.  The idea is that executing <var>Body</var>
will reinstate blocked goals and attributes on the variables in <var>Copy</var>
equivalent to those on the variables in <var>Term</var>.

     <br><dt><code>profile_reset/0</code><dt><code>profile_data/1</code><dt><code>print_profile/[0,1]</code><dt><code>coverage_data/1</code><dt><code>print_coverage/[0,1]</code><dd>As of release 4.2, the execution profiling technology has been
reengineered, eliminating the need to specially instrument code before
it could be profiled.  Execution profiling is available for compiled as
well as interpreted code.  It has been generalized to support coverage
analysis for compiled as well as interpreted code.  The new scheme also
keeps track of the number of calls per caller-callee pair.  These are
the relevant new built-in predicates. 
</dl>

   <p>Some predicates have been changed slightly; in most cases, this
affects predicates that take a list of options:

     <dl>
<dt><code>[</code><var>F1</var><code>,</code><var>F2</var><code>,...]</code><dd>
This is now a short-hand for <code>load_files([</code><var>F1</var><code>,</code><var>F2</var><code>,...])</code>.

     <br><dt><code>is_mutable/1</code><dd>
The predicate <code>is_mutable/1</code> has been renamed to
<code>mutable/1</code>, in analogy with <code>integer/1</code>, <code>atom/1</code> etc.

     <br><dt><code>module/1</code><dd>
The predicate <code>module/1</code> has been renamed to
<code>set_module/1</code>, to avoid possible confusion with the
<code>module/2</code> declaration.

     <br><dt><code>format/[2,3]</code><dd>
For the predicate <code>format/[2,3]</code>, the semantics of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~@</span></samp>&rsquo;
spec has changed slightly: the goal <var>Arg</var> is called as if by
<code>\+ \+ </code><var>Arg</var>, i.e. any bindings made by the goal are lost.

     <br><dt><code>close/2</code><dd>
Takes new options:

          <dl>
<dt><code>direction/1</code><dd>Specifies which directions to close. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>open/4</code><dd>
The <code>wcx/1</code> option has been dropped. 
Takes several new options. 
See <a href="../sicstus/mpg_002dref_002dopen.html#mpg_002dref_002dopen"><code>open/4</code></a>.

     <!-- [PM] 4.1.0 has become out-of-date -->
     <!-- @table @code -->
     <!-- @item encoding_signature/1 -->
     <!-- @itemx encoding/1 -->
     <!-- @itemx eol/1 -->
     <!-- Correspond to the respective stream properties. -->
     <!-- @item if_exists/1 -->
     <!-- Specifies what should happen if the file already exists. -->
     <!-- @end table -->
     <br><dt><code>absolute_file_name/[2,3]</code><dd>
The <code>ignore_underscores/1</code> option has been dropped. 
The <code>file_type/1</code> option representation <code>ql</code> has been dropped,
whereas the option representation <code>executable</code> is new.
The <code>access/1</code> option values <code>execute</code>,
<code>executable</code> and <code>search</code> are new. 
The <code>glob/1</code> option is new, allowing to match file names against a
pattern. 
If available, the load
context directory (<code>prolog_load_context/2</code>) will be used as default directory.

     <br><dt><code>load_files/2</code><dd>
The <code>load_type/1</code> option representation <code>ql</code> has been dropped.
<code>encoding_signature/1</code>, <code>encoding/1</code>, subsuming the <code>wcx/1</code> option of
release 3, and <code>eol/1</code>, are new options, corresponding to the
respective stream properties.

     <br><dt><code>write_term/3</code><dd>
The <code>quoted_charset/1</code> option is new, reflecting the representation of the
Prolog flag with the same name.

     <br><dt><code>halt/1</code><dd>
The predicate <code>halt/1</code> now raises an internal exception like
<code>halt/0</code>. This gives surrounding Prolog and C code an opportunity
to perform cleanup.

     <br><dt><code>append/3</code><dt><code>member/2</code><dt><code>memberchk/2</code><dd>These are now built-in, they used to reside in <code>library(lists)</code>.

   </dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">13.1.2.10 Hook Predicates</h5>

<p>The hook <code>user:term_expansion/[2,4]</code> is replaced by the hook:

<pre class="example">     user:term_expansion(Term1, Layout1, Tokens,
                         Term2, Layout2, [Token|Tokens]).
</pre>
   <p>The purpose of the new argument <var>Tokens</var> is to support multiple,
independent expansion rules.  The
purpose of the arguments <var>Layout1</var> and <var>Layout2</var> is to support
source-linked debugging of term-expanded code. Each expansion rule
should have its unique identifying token <var>Token</var>.

   <p>The hook <code>user:goal_expansion/3</code> is replaced by the following per-module hook:

<pre class="example">     M:goal_expansion(Term1, Layout1,
                      Module, Term2, Layout2).
</pre>
   <p>Typically, <var>Module</var> has imported the predicate <var>Term1</var> from
module <var>M</var>. The purpose of the arguments <var>Layout1</var> and
<var>Layout2</var> is to support source-linked debugging of goal-expanded
code.
