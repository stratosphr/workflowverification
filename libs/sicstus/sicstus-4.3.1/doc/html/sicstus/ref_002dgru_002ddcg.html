<h4 class="subsection">4.14.1 Definite Clause Grammars</h4>

<p><a name="index-grammars_002c-definite-clause-1654"></a><a name="index-definite-clause-grammars-1655"></a><a name="index-DCG-1656"></a><a name="index-g_t_002d_002d_003e_002c-grammar-rules-1657"></a>
Prolog's grammar rules provide a convenient notation for
expressing definite clause grammars, which are useful for the
analysis of both artificial and natural languages.

   <p>The usual way one attempts to make precise the definition of a
language, whether it is a natural language or a programming language,
is through a collection of rules called a &ldquo;grammar&rdquo;.  The rules of a
grammar define which strings of words or symbols are valid sentences
of the language.  In addition, the grammar generally analyzes the
sentence into a structure that makes its meaning more explicit.

   <p>A fundamental class of grammar is the context-free grammar (CFG),
familiar to the computing community in the notation of &ldquo;BNF&rdquo;
(Backus-Naur form). In CFGs, the words, or basic symbols, of the
language are identified by &ldquo;terminal symbols&rdquo;, while categories of
phrases of the language are identified by non-terminal symbols.  Each
rule of a CFG expresses a possible form for a non-terminal, as a
sequence of terminals and non-terminals.  The analysis of a string
according to a CFG is a parse tree, showing the constitutent phrases
of the string and their hierarchical relationships.

   <p>Context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of a series of rules of the form:
<pre class="example">     <var>nt</var> --&gt; <var>body</var>.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>nt</var> is a non-terminal symbol and body is a sequence of one or
more items separated by commas.  Each item is either a non-terminal
symbol or a sequence of terminal symbols.  The meaning of the rule is
that <var>body</var> is a possible form for a phrase of type <var>nt</var>. A
non-terminal symbol is written as a Prolog atom, while a sequence of
terminals is written as a Prolog list, whereas a terminal may be any
Prolog term.

   <p><a name="index-grammars_002c-context_002dfree-1658"></a><a name="index-context_002dfree-grammars-1659"></a>
Definite clause grammars (DCGs) are a generalization of context-free grammars
and rules corresponding to DCGs are referred to as &ldquo;Grammar Rules&rdquo;. 
A grammar rule in Prolog takes the general form
<pre class="example">     <var>head</var> --&gt; <var>body</var>.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">meaning &ldquo;a possible form for  <var>head</var>  is  <var>body</var>&rdquo;. 
Both  <var>body</var>  and  <var>head</var>  are
sequences  of  one  or  more  items  linked  by  the  standard  Prolog
conjunction operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; (comma).

   <p>Definite clause grammars  extend  context-free  grammars  in  the
following ways:

     <ul>
<li>A non-terminal symbol  may  be  any  callable Prolog  term. 
<li>A  terminal  symbol  may  be  any  Prolog  term.   To  distinguish
terminals  from  non-terminals,  a  sequence  of  one or more terminal
symbols is written within a grammar rule as a Prolog list.   An  empty
sequence  is  written  as the empty list &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo;. If the terminal symbols
are character codes, such lists can be written (as elsewhere) as
strings.  An empty sequence is written as the empty list (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">""</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
<a name="index-g_t_005b_005d_002c-empty-grammar-body-1660"></a>
<li>Extra conditions, in the form of Prolog procedure  calls,  may  be
included  in  the  right-hand  side of a grammar rule. 
These extra conditions allow the explicit use of procedure calls in the
body of a rule to restrict the constitutents accepted.  Such procedure
calls are written enclosed in curly brackets (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
<li>The left-hand side of a grammar rule consists of  a  non-terminal,
optionally  followed  by  a  sequence of terminals (again written as a
Prolog list). 
<li>Alternatives may be stated explicitly in the right-hand side of  a
grammar rule, using the disjunction operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; (semicolon)
as in Prolog. 
<!-- [PM] 4.3 Not true (Mats disabled the special casing of '|'/2 in 4.3beta7) -->
<!-- The disjunction operator can also be written as @samp{|} -->
<!-- (vertical-bar), even if @samp{|} has been defined as an infix operator. -->
<li>The cut symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; may be included in the right-hand side of a
grammar rule, as in a Prolog clause.  The cut symbol does not need to
be enclosed in curly brackets.  The same is true for the control
constructs. However, all other built-in predicates not enclosed in
curly brackets will be treated as non-terminal symbols.  The precise
meaning of this rule is clarified in <a href="ref_002dgru_002dtra.html#ref_002dgru_002dtra">ref-gru-tra</a>. 
<a name="index-grammar-rules_002c-control-constructs-in-1661"></a><a name="index-control-constructs-in-grammar-rules-1662"></a><li>The extra arguments of non-terminals provide the means of building
structure (such as parse trees) in grammar rules.  As non-terminals
are &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; by matching against grammar rules, structures are
progressively built up in the course of the unification process. 
<li>The extra arguments of non-terminals can also provide a general treatment
of context dependency by carrying test and contextual information.
