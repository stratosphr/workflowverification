<h5 class="subsubsection">4.2.3.1 The Cut</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0021_002f0_002c-cut-594"></a><a name="index-g_t_0021_002f0_002c-cut-595"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0021_002c-cut-596"></a>Besides the sequencing of goals and clauses, Prolog provides one
other  very  important  facility  for  specifying control information. 
This is the <dfn>cut</dfn>, written &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
It is  inserted  in  the  program
just  like  a  goal, but is not to be regarded as part of the logic of
the program and should be ignored as far as the declarative  semantics
is concerned.

   <p>The  effect  of  the  cut  is  as  follows.   When  first
encountered  as  a  goal,  cut  succeeds immediately.  If backtracking
should later return to the cut, the effect  is  to  fail  the  <em>parent
goal</em>, i.e. the goal that matched the head of the clause containing
the cut, and caused the clause to be activated.  In other  words,  the
cut  operation <em>commits</em> the system to all choices made since the parent
goal was invoked, and causes other alternatives to be discarded.   The
goals  thus  rendered  <em>determinate</em>  are  the parent goal itself, any
goals occurring before the cut in the clause containing the  cut,  and
any  subgoals  that  were  executed  during  the  execution  of those
preceding goals.

   <p>For example, the procedure
<pre class="example">     member(X, [X|L]).
     member(X, [Y|L]) :-
        member(X, L).
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">can be used to test whether a given term is in a list:
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>member(b, [a,b,c]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">returns the answer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The procedure can also be used to extract elements from a list, as in
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>member(X, [d,e,f]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>With backtracking this will successively return each element of the list. 
Now suppose that the first clause had been written instead:
<pre class="example">     member(X, [X|L]) :- !.
</pre>
   <p>In this case, the second call above would extract only the first element
of the list (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
On backtracking, the cut would immediately fail the entire procedure.

   <p>Another example:
<pre class="example">     x :- p, !, q.
     x :- r.
</pre>
   <p>This is analogous to &ldquo;if p then q else r&rdquo; in an Algol-like language.

   <p>Note that a cut discards all the alternatives subsequent to
the parent goal, even when the cut appears within  a  disjunction.  This
means  that  the normal method for eliminating a disjunction&mdash;by
defining
an extra predicate&mdash;cannot be applied to a disjunction containing a
cut.

   <p><a name="index-green-cut-597"></a><a name="index-cut_002c-green-598"></a><a name="index-red-cut-599"></a><a name="index-cut_002c-red-600"></a>A proper use of the cut is usually a major difficulty for new
Prolog programmers.  The usual mistakes are to over-use cut, and
to let cuts destroy the logic.  A cut that doesn't destroy
the logic is called a <dfn>green cut</dfn>; a cut that does is called a
<dfn>red cut</dfn>.  We would like to advise all users to follow these
general rules.  Also see <a href="Writing-Efficient-Programs.html#Writing-Efficient-Programs">Writing Efficient Programs</a>.

     <ul>
<li>Write each clause as a self-contained logic rule, which just
defines the truth of goals that match its head.  Then add
cuts to remove any fruitless alternative computation paths that
may tie up memory. 
<li>Cuts are hardly ever needed in the last clause of a predicate. 
<li>Use cuts sparingly, and <em>only</em> at proper places. 
A cut should be placed at the exact point that it
is known that the current choice is the correct one; no sooner, no
later, usually placed right after the head, sometimes preceded by simple
tests. 
<li>Make cuts as local in their effect as possible.  If a
predicate is intended to be determinate, define <em>it</em> as
such; don't rely on its callers to prevent unintended
backtracking. 
<li>Binding output arguments before a cut is a common
source of programming errors.  If a predicate is not steadfast, it is
usually for this reason. 
</ul>

   <p>To illustrate the last issue, suppose that you want to write a
predicate <code>max/3</code> that finds the greater of two numbers.  The
pure version is:

<pre class="example">     max(X, Y, X) :- X &gt;= Y.
     max(X, Y, Y) :- X &lt; Y.
</pre>
   <p>Now since the two conditions are mutually exclusive, we can add a
green cut to the first clause:

<pre class="example">     max(X, Y, X) :- X &gt;= Y, !.
     max(X, Y, Y) :- X &lt; Y.
</pre>
   <p>Furthermore, if the <code>X &gt;= Y</code> test fails we know that <code>X &lt; Y</code>
must be true, and therefore it is tempting to turn the green cut into
a red one and drop the <code>X &lt; Y</code> test:

<pre class="example">     max(X, Y, X) :- X &gt;= Y, !.
     max(X, Y, Y).
</pre>
   <p>Unfortunately, this version of <code>max/3</code> can give wrong answers,
for example:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>max(10, 0, 0).</kbd>
     yes
</pre>
   <p>The reason is that the query doesn't match the head of the first
clause, and so we never executed the <code>X &gt;= Y</code> test.  When we
dropped the <code>X &lt; Y</code> test, we made the mistake of assuming that
the head of the first clause would match any query. This is an example
of a predicate that is <dfn>not steadfast</dfn>.  A steadfast version is:

<pre class="example">     max(X, Y, Z) :- X &gt;= Y, !, Z = X.
     max(X, Y, Y).
</pre>
