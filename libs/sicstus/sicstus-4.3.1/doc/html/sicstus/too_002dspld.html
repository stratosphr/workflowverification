<p><a name="index-spld_00281_0029-_0028command-line-tool_0029-5245"></a>

<h4 class="subheading">Synopsis</h4>

<pre class="example">     % <kbd>spld [ </kbd><var>Option</var><kbd> | </kbd><var>InputFile</var><kbd> ] ...</kbd>
</pre>
<h4 class="subheading">Description</h4>

<p>The application builder, <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp>, is used for creating
stand-alone executables. See <a href="The-Application-Builder.html#The-Application-Builder">The Application Builder</a> for an overview.

   <p><samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> takes the files specified on the command line and combines
them into an executable file, much like the UNIX <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> or the
Windows <samp><span class="command">link</span></samp> commands.

   <p>Note that no pathnames passed to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> should contain spaces. 
Under Windows, this can be avoided by using the short version of
pathnames as necessary.

<h4 class="subheading">Options</h4>

<p>The input to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> can be divided into <var>Options</var> and
<var>Files</var>, which can be arbitrarily mixed on the command line. Anything
not interpreted as an option will be interpreted as an input file. Do
not use spaces in any file or option passed to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp>. 
Under Windows you can use the short file name for files with space in their
name. The following options are available:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">-?</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp><dd>Prints out a summary of all options. This may document more options than
those described in this manual.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp><dd>Print detailed information about each step in the compilation/linking
sequence. Multiple occurrences increase verbosity.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-vv</span></samp><dd>Same as -v -v.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--version</span></samp><dd>Prints out the version number of <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> and exits successfully.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--output=</span><var>filename</var></samp><dd>Specify output file name. The default depends on the linker (e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">a.out</span></samp> on UNIX systems).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--extended-rt</span></samp><dd>Create an extended runtime system.  In addition to the normal set
of built-in runtime system predicates, extended runtime
systems include the compiler.  Extended runtime systems
require the extended runtime library, available from SICS as an
add-on product. Extended runtime systems need access to license
information; see <a href="Extended-Runtime-Systems.html#Extended-Runtime-Systems">Extended Runtime Systems</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--development</span></samp><dd>Create a development system (with top-level, debugger,

This option is not compatible with <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>. See <a href="User_002ddefined-Main-Programs.html#User_002ddefined-Main-Programs">User-defined Main Programs</a>.

          <br><dt><code>restore</code><dd><a name="index-restore-_0028_002d_002dmain-option-value_0029-5252"></a>The executable will restore a saved-state created by
<code>save_program/[1,2]</code>. This is the default if a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.sav</span></samp>&rsquo; file is
found among <var>Files</var>. It is only meaningful to specify one
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.sav</span></samp>&rsquo; file.  If it was created by <code>save_program/2</code>, the given
startup goal is run.  Then the executable will any Prolog code
specified on the command line.  Finally, the goal
<code>user:runtime_entry(start)</code> is run.  The executable exits with 0

compatible with <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>load</code><dd><a name="index-load-_0028_002d_002dmain-option-value_0029-5253"></a>The executable will load any Prolog code specified on the command
line, i.e. files with extension &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.pl</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.po</span></samp>&rsquo;. <!-- or @samp{.ql}. -->
This is the default if there are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.pl</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.po</span></samp>&rsquo; <!-- or @samp{.ql} -->
but no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.sav</span></samp>&rsquo; files among <var>Files</var>.  Finally, the
goal <code>user:runtime_entry(start)</code> is run.  The executable
exits with 0 upon normal temination and with 1 on failure or exception. 
Not compatible with <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>. Note that this is almost like
<samp><span class="option">--main==restore</span></samp> except that no saved-state will be
restored before loading the other files.

          <br><dt><code>none</code><dd><a name="index-none-_0028_002d_002dmain-option-value_0029-5254"></a>No main function is generated. The main function must be supplied in one

     </dl>

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--window</span></samp><dd>
<em>Win32 only.</em> Create a windowed executable. A console window
will be opened and connected to the Prolog standard streams. If
<samp><span class="option">--main=user</span></samp> is specified, <code>user_main()</code> should not set the
user-stream hooks.  C/C++ source code files specified on the
command-line will be compiled with <samp><span class="option">-DSP_WIN=1</span></samp> if this option is
given.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--moveable</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--no-moveable</span></samp><dd>
<!-- This should change, -moveable should be made the default [PM] -->
<!-- is working on that (Update: -moveable should probably not be the -->
<!-- default/PM since it would require a (or, link to a) complete -->
<!-- directory structure  in the same folder as the generated exe) -->

     <p>Controls whether to hardcode certain paths into the executable in order
for it to find the SICStus libraries and bootfiles etc.

     <p>Under UNIX, if <samp><span class="option">--no-moveable</span></samp> is specified, paths are hardcoded
into executables in order for
them to find the SICStus libraries and bootfiles. Two paths are normally
hardcoded; the representation of <samp><span class="env">SP_PATH</span></samp> and, where possible, the runtime
library search path using the <samp><span class="option">-R</span></samp> linker option (or
equivalent). If the linker does not support the <samp><span class="option">-R</span></samp> option (or an
equivalent), a wrapper script is generated instead, which sets
<samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> (or equivalent).

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">--moveable</span></samp> option turns off this behavior, so the executable
is not dependent on SICStus being installed in a specific place. 
On most platforms the executable can figure out where it is located and
so can locate any files it need, e.g. using <samp><span class="env">SP_APP_DIR</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="env">SP_RT_DIR</span></samp>. On some UNIX platforms, however, this is not possible. 
In these cases, <samp><span class="option">--moveable</span></samp> is in effect, the executable will rely on the system properties and
enviroment variables
(<samp><span class="env">SP_PATH</span></samp> (see <a href="System-Properties-and-Environment-Variables.html#System-Properties-and-Environment-Variables">System Properties and Environment Variables</a>) and
<samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> etc.) to find all relevant files.

     <p>Under Windows, <samp><span class="option">--moveable</span></samp> is always on, since Windows
applications don't need to hardcode paths in order for them to find out
where they are installed.  On UNIX platforms, <code>--moveable</code> is the
default (as of release 4.2) but can be turned off with
<samp><span class="option">--no-moveable</span></samp>. See <a href="Runtime-Systems-on-Target-Machines.html#Runtime-Systems-on-Target-Machines">Runtime Systems on Target Machines</a> for
more information on how SICStus locates its libraries and bootfiles.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp><dt><samp><span class="option">--static</span></samp><dd>Link statically with SICStus runtime and foreign resources.  When
<samp><span class="option">--static</span></samp> is specified, a static version of the SICStus runtime
will be used and any SICStus foreign resources specified with
<samp><span class="option">--resources</span></samp> will be statically linked with the executable. In
addition, <samp><span class="option">--static</span></samp> implies <samp><span class="option">--embed-rt-sav</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">--embed-sav-file</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--resources-from-sav</span></samp>.

     <!-- Prefer static linking over dynamic. When @option{-static} is specified, -->
     <!-- @command{spld} will try to use static (not shared) versions of libraries and -->
     <!-- object-files. This option can be used to minimize runtime dependencies -->
     <!-- on shared libraries/object-files. -->
     <!-- In particular, a static version of the SICStus runtime will be used and -->
     <!-- any SICStus foreign resources specified with @option{-resources} will be -->
     <!-- statically linked with the executable. In addition, @option{-static} -->
     <!-- implies @option{-embed-rt-sav}. -->
     <!-- Under UNIX, even if there is a static version of a library (such as for -->
     <!-- example Tcl/Tk (@code{libtcl8.0.a}), @command{spld} may still use the -->
     <!-- dynamic version (@code{libtcl8.0.so}). This is because there is no -->
     <!-- portable way of telling the linker to @emph{prefer} static libraries -->
     <!-- over shared, it is usually only possible to link statically @emph{or} -->
     <!-- dynamically; the modes are usually exclusive. In this case, -->
     <p>Even with <samp><span class="option">--static</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> will go with the linker's
default, which is usually dynamic. If you are in a situation where you
would want <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> to use a static library instead of a dynamic
one, you will have to hack into <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp>'s configuration file
<samp><span class="file">spconfig-</span><var>version</var></samp> (normally located in
<samp><span class="file">&lt;installdir&gt;/bin</span></samp>). We recommend that you make a copy of the
configuration file and specify the new configuration file using
<samp><span class="option">--config=&lt;file&gt;</span></samp>. A typical modification of the configuration
file for this purpose may look like:
     <pre class="example">          [...]
          TCLLIB=-Bstatic -L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.0 -ltcl8.0 -Bdynamic
          [...]
</pre>
     <p>Use the new configuration file by typing
     <pre class="example">          % <kbd>spld [...] -S --config=/home/joe/hacked_spldconfig [...]</kbd>
</pre>
     <p>The SICStus runtime depends on certain OS support that is only available
in dynamically linked executables. For this reason it will probably not
work to try to tell the linker to build a completely static executable,
i.e. an executable that links statically also with the C library and
that cannot load shared objects.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--shared</span></samp><dd>Create a shared library runtime system instead of an ordinary
executable. Not compatible with <samp><span class="option">--static</span></samp>. Implies
<samp><span class="option">--main=none</span></samp>.

     <p>Not supported on all platforms.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--resources=</span><var>ResourceList</var></samp><dd><var>ResourceList</var> is a comma-separated list of resource names,
describing which resources should be prelinked with the
executable. Names can be either simple resource names, for example
<code>tcltk</code>, or they can be complete paths to a foreign resource
(with or without extensions). Example
     <pre class="example">          % <kbd>spld [...] --resources=tcltk,clpfd,/home/joe/foobar.so</kbd>
</pre>
     <p>This will cause <code>library(tcltk)</code>, <code>library(clpfd)</code>, and
<samp><span class="file">/home/joe/foobar.so</span></samp> to be prelinked with the executable. See
also the option <samp><span class="option">--respath</span></samp> below.

     <!-- FIXME more on this, synch with the examples -->
     <p><a name="index-data-resource-5255"></a><a name="index-resource_002c-data-5256"></a>It is also possible to embed a <dfn>data resource</dfn>, that is, the
contents of an arbitrary data file that can be accessed at runtime.

     <p>It is possible to embed any kind of data, but, currently, only
<code>restore/1</code> knows about data resources. For this reason it only
makes sense to embed &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.sav</span></samp>&rsquo; files.

     <!-- Data resources are added by specifying their internal name and their -->
     <!-- location as part of the comma separated list of resources passed with -->
     <!-- the @command{spld} option @option{-resources}. Each data resource is -->
     <!-- specified as @var{file}=@var{name} where @var{file} is the name of the -->
     <!-- file containing the data (it must exist during the call to @command{spld}) -->
     <!-- and @var{name} is the name used to access the content of @var{file} -->
     <!-- during runtime. -->
     <!-- It is possible to embed any kind of data using this syntax, but, -->
     <!-- currently, only @code{restore/1} knows about data resources. For this -->
     <!-- reason it only makes sense to embed @samp{.sav} files. -->
     <p>The primary reason to embed files within the executable is to create an
all-in-one executable, that is, an executable file that does not depend
on any other files and that therefore is easy to run on machines without
SICStus installed.  See <a href="All_002din_002done-Executables.html#All_002din_002done-Executables">All-in-one Executables</a> for more information.

embedded saved-state about the names of the foreign
resources that were loaded when the saved-state was created. This
is the default for static executables when no other resource is
specified except the embedded saved-state. This option is only
supported when a saved-state is embedded as a data
resource. See <a href="All_002din_002done-Executables.html#All_002din_002done-Executables">All-in-one Executables</a> for more information.

     <p>The current behavior is that if <var>CFlag</var> contains commas then each
comma-separated part is treated as a separate compiler option. This may
change in the future, so instead you should use multiple occurences of
<samp><span class="option">--cflag</span></samp>. To turn off splitting at commas and treat <var>CFlag</var> as a
single option even it contains a comma, you can pass the option
<samp><span class="option">--conf SPLIT_OPT_CFLAG=0</span></samp>. This can be useful with certain

     <p>Setting the process locale from the environment can suppressed by
passing the <samp><span class="option">--no-locale</span></samp> option to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp>. This
corresponds to the behavior prior to release 4.3.

     <p>An explicit locale that the process should set on inititialization,

   <p>There may be additional, undocumented, options, some of which may be
described with the <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> option.

<h4 class="subheading">Files</h4>

<p>Arguments to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> not recognized as options are assumed
to be input-files and are handled as follows:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.pro</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.pl</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.po</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>These are interpreted as names of files containing Prolog code and will
be passed to <code>SP_load()</code> at runtime (if <samp><span class="option">--main</span></samp> is
<code>load</code> or <code>restore</code>. 
<strong>Please note:</strong>
If the intention is to make an executable that works independently of
the working directory at run time, avoid relative file names, for they
will be resolved at run time, not at <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> time. 
Use absolute
file names instead, <samp><span class="env">SP_APP_DIR</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">SP_LIBRARY_DIR</span></samp>, or embed a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.sav</span></samp>&rsquo; file as a data resource, using <samp><span class="option">--resource</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.sav</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>These are interpreted as names of files containing saved-states
and will be passed to <code>SP_restore()</code> at runtime if
<samp><span class="option">--main=restore</span></samp> is specified, subject to the above caveat about
relative file names.

     <p>It is not meaningful to give more than one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.sav</span></samp>&rsquo; argument.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.so</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.sl</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.s.o</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.o</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.obj</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.dll</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.lib</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.dylib</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>These files are assumed to be input-files to the linker and will be
passed on unmodified.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.c</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.cc</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.C</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.cpp</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.c++</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>These files are assumed to be C/C++ source code and will be
compiled by the C/C++-compiler before being passed to the linker. 
</dl>

   <p>If an argument is still not recognized, it will be passed
unmodified to the linker.
