<h5 class="subsubsection">10.22.2.2 Slots</h5>

<p>A slot description has the form

<pre class="example">     <var>Visibility</var> <var>SlotName</var>:<var>SlotType</var> = <var>InitialValue</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>Visibility</var> and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">= </span><var>InitialValue</var></samp>&rsquo; are optional. Each slot
of a class must have a distinct name, given by the atom
<var>SlotName</var>. The <var>Visibility</var>, <var>SlotType</var> and <var>InitialValue</var>
parts of the slot description are described separately.

<h4 class="subheading">Visibility</h4>

<p>A slot's visibility is either private, protected, or public. If its visibility
is not specified, the slot is private. The following example shows
all four possibilities:

<pre class="example">     :- class example = [w:integer,
                         private   x:integer,
                         protected y:integer,
                         public    z:integer]
</pre>
   <p>Slot <code>z</code> is public, <code>y</code> is protected, and both <code>x</code> and <code>w</code> are
private.

   <p>Direct access to private slots is strictly limited to the methods of
the class.  Any other access to such slots must be accomplished
through these methods.  Making slots private will allow you
later to change how you represent your class, adding and removing
slots, without having to change any code that uses your class.  You
need only modify the methods of the class to accomodate that change. 
This is known as <dfn>information hiding</dfn>.

   <p>Protected slots are much like private slots, except that they can also
be directly accessed by subclasses.  This means that if you wish to
modify the representation of your class, you will need to examine not
only the class itself, but also its subclasses.

   <p>Public slots, in contrast, can be accessed from anywhere.  This is
accomplished through automatically generated get and put methods named
for the slot and taking one argument.  In the example above, our
<code>example</code> class would automatically support a get and put method
named <code>z/1</code>.  Note, however, that unlike other object oriented
programming languages that support them, public slots in SICStus
Objects don't violate information hiding.  This is because you may
easily replace a public slot with your own get and put methods of the
same name.  In this sense, a public slot is really only a protected
slot with automatically generated methods to fetch and store its
contents.

   <p>Within a method clause, any of the class's slots can be accessed via
the <code>fetch_slot/2</code> and <code>store_slot/2</code> predicates. These are the
only way to access private and protected slots. They may be used to
define get and put methods for the class, which provide controlled
access to the protected slots. But, they can only be used within the
method clauses for the class, and they can only refer to slots of the
current class and protected and public slots of superclasses.

   <p>In the slot description, <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code> and <code>private</code> are
used as prefix operators. The <code>obj_decl</code> module redefines the prefix
operator <code>public</code>, as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- op(600, fy, [public]).
</pre>
   <p>Unless you use the obsolete <code>public/1</code> directive in your Prolog
programs, this should cause no problems.

<h4 class="subheading">Types</h4>

<!-- label types -->
<p>A slot's type restricts the kinds of values it may contain. The slot
is specified in the slot description by one of the following Prolog
terms with the corresponding meaning.  Most of these will be
familiar, but the last four, <code>address</code>, <code>term</code>, <var>Class</var> and
<code>pointer(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>, require some additional explanation:

     <dl>
<dt><code>integer</code><dd>signed integer, large enough to hold a pointer

     <br><dt><code>integer_64 &nbsp;<!-- /@w --> </code><strong>since release 4.3</strong><dd>64-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>integer_32</code><dd>32-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>integer_16</code><dd>16-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>integer_8</code><dd>8-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned</code><dd>unsigned integer, large enough to hold a pointer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_64 &nbsp;<!-- /@w --> </code><strong>since release 4.3</strong><dd>64-bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_32</code><dd>32-bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_16</code><dd>16-bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_8</code><dd>8-bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>float</code><dd>64-bit floating point number

     <br><dt><code>float_32</code><dd>32-bit floating point number

     <br><dt><code>atom</code><dd>Prolog atom

     <br><dt><code>address</code><dd>Pointer. 
The <code>address</code> type is intended for use with foreign code. 
A slot of this type might store an address returned from
a foreign function. That address might, in turn, be used
in calling another foreign function. Hence, most Prolog programmers can
safely ignore this type.

     <br><dt><code>term</code><dd>Prolog term. 
The <code>term</code> type is for general Prolog terms. Such a slot
can hold any of the other types. However, if you know
a slot will be used to hold only values of a particular
type, it is more efficient to specify that type in the class
definition.

     <p>Storing a term containing free variables is similar to
asserting a clause containing free variables into the
Prolog database. The free variables in the term are replaced
with new variables in the stored copy. And, when you
fetch the term from the slot, you are really fetching a
copy of the term, again with new variables.

     <br><dt><var>Class</var><dd>where <var>Class</var> is the name of a defined class. 
The class type is for any object in a class defined with
SICStus Objects. Such a slot holds an object of its class
or one of that class's descendants, or the <code>null</code> object.

     <br><dt><code>pointer(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code><dd>where <var>Type</var> is an atom. 
The pointer type is intended for use with the Structs Package.  It is
similar to the <code>address</code> type, except that access to this slot
yields, and update to this slot expects, a term of arity 1 whose
functor is <var>Type</var> and whose argument is the address. Again, most Prolog
programmers can safely ignore this type.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Initial Values</h4>

<p>A slot description may optionally specify an initial representation for the
slot. The initial representation is the representation of the slot in every instance of
the class, when the object is first created. The initial representation must be
a constant of the correct type for the slot.

   <p>If an initial representation is not specified, a slot is initialized to a representation
that depends on its type. All numbers are initialized to 0, of the
appropriate type. Atom and term slots are initialized to the
empty atom
(<code>''</code>). Addresses and pointers are initialized to null pointers. And,
objects are initialized to the <code>null</code> object.

   <p>More complicated initialization&mdash;not the same constant for every
instance of the class&mdash;must be performed by create methods, which are
described later.

<h4 class="subheading">The <code>null</code> object</h4>

<!-- label null-object -->
<p>The <code>null</code> object is a special object that is not an instance of any
class, but that can be stored in a slot intended for any class of
object.  This is very much like the <code>NULL</code> pointer in C.  This is
useful when you don't yet have an object to store in a particular
slot.

   <p>In Prolog, the <code>null</code> is represented by the atom <code>null</code>.

   <p>Note that because the <code>null</code> object is not really an object of any
class, you cannot determine its class with <code>class_of/2</code>.  Unless
noted otherwise, when we write of an <dfn>object</dfn> in this document, we
don't include the <code>null</code> object.
