<h4 class="subsection">5.6.5 Breakpoint Actions</h4>

<p><a name="index-breakpoint-action-2024"></a><a name="index-action_002c-breakpoint-2025"></a><a name="index-debugger-action-variables-2026"></a><a name="index-action-variables_002c-debugger-2027"></a>The action part of a breakpoint spec supplies information to the
debugger as to what should be done when the breakpoint is
activated. This is achieved by setting the three so called <dfn>debugger
action variables</dfn>. These are listed below, together with their most
important values.

   <p><a name="index-show_002f1-_0028debugger-condition_0029-2028"></a><a name="index-command_002f1-_0028debugger-condition_0029-2029"></a><a name="index-mode_002f1-_0028debugger-condition_0029-2030"></a>
     <ul>
<li>The <code>show</code> variable prescribes how the debugged goal should
be displayed:

          <dl>
<dt><code>print</code><dd>write the goal according to
the <code>debugger_print_options</code> Prolog flag. 
<a name="index-debugger_005fprint_005foptions-_0028prolog-flag_0029-2031"></a><br><dt><code>silent</code><dd>don't display the goal. 
</dl>

     <li>The <code>command</code> variable prescribes what the debugger should do:

          <dl>
<dt><code>ask</code><dd>ask the user. 
<br><dt><code>proceed</code><dd>continue the execution without stopping, creating a procedure
box for the current goal at the Call port,
<br><dt><code>flit</code><dd>continue the execution without stopping, without creating a procedure
box for the current goal at the Call port. 
</dl>

     <li>The <code>mode</code> variable prescribes in what mode the debugger should
continue the execution:

          <dl>
<dt><code>trace</code><dd>creeping. 
<br><dt><code>debug</code><dd>leaping. 
<br><dt><code>zip</code><dd>zipping. 
<br><dt><code>off</code><dd>without debugging. 
</dl>
     </ul>

   <p>For example, the breakpoint below specifies that whenever the Exit
port of <code>foo/2</code> is reached, no trace message should be
output, no interaction should take place and the debugger should be
switched off.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>add_breakpoint([pred(foo/2),port(exit)]-</kbd>
                         <kbd>[show(silent),command(proceed),mode(off)], _).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>Here, the action part consists of three actions, setting the three
action variables. This breakpoint spec can be simplified by
omitting the wrappers around the variable values, as the sets of
possible values of the variables are all disjoint. If we use
<code>spy/2</code>, the <code>pred</code> wrapper goes away, too, resulting in a
much more concise, equivalent formulation of the above breakpoint:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2,exit-[silent,proceed,off]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>Let us now revisit the process of breakpoint selection. When the
debugger arrives at a port it first initializes the action
variables according to the current debugging and leashing modes,
as shown below:

<pre class="example">     debugging    leashing           |        Action variables
     mode         mode               |  show        command     mode
     --------------------------------|-------------------------------
     trace        at leashed port    |  print       ask         trace
                                     |
     trace        at unleashed port  |  print       proceed     trace
                                     |
     debug        -                  |  silent      proceed     debug
                                     |
     zip          -                  |  silent      flit        zip
</pre>
   <p>It then considers each breakpoint, most recent first, until it
finds a breakpoint whose test part succeeds. If such a
breakpoint is found, its action part is evaluated, normally
changing the action variable settings. A failure of the action part is
ignored, in the sense that the breakpoint is still treated as the
selected one.  However, as a side-effect, a procedure box
will always be built in such cases. More precisely, the failure of the
action part causes the <code>flit</code> command representation to be changed to
<code>proceed</code>, all other command values being left unchanged. This is
to facilitate the creation of breakpoints that stop at non-Call
ports (see below for an example).

   <p>If no applicable breakpoint is found, the action variables
remain unchanged.

   <p><a name="index-action-execution_002c-breakpoint-2032"></a><a name="index-breakpoint-action-execution-2033"></a>The debugger then executes the actions specified by the action
variables.  This process, referred to as the <dfn>action execution</dfn>,
means the following:
     <ul>
<li>The current debugging mode is set to
the representation of the <code>mode</code> action variable.
<li>A trace message is displayed according to the <code>show</code> variable. 
<li>The program continues according to the <code>command</code> variable. 
</ul>

   <p>Specifically, if <code>command</code> is <code>ask</code>, the user is prompted
for a debugger command, which in turn is converted to new assignments to
the action variables. The debugger will then repeat the action execution
process, described above. For example, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&rsquo; (creep) interactive
command is converted to <code>[silent,proceed,trace]</code>, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;
(display) command to <code>[display,ask]</code> (when command is <code>ask</code>,
the mode is irrelevant), etc.

   <p>The default values of the action variables correspond to the standard
debugger behavior described in <a href="Basic-Debug.html#Basic-Debug">Basic Debug</a>. For example, when an
unleashed port is reached in trace mode, a trace
message is printed and the execution proceeds in trace mode,
without stopping. In zip mode, no trace message is shown, and
execution continues in zip mode, without building procedure
boxes at Call ports.

   <p>Note that a spypoint action part that is empty (<code>[]</code> or not
present) is actually treated as <code>[print,ask]</code>. Again, this is the
standard behavior of spypoints, as described in <a href="Basic-Debug.html#Basic-Debug">Basic Debug</a>.

   <p>If an action part is nonempty, but it does not set the action variables,
the only effect it will have is to hide the remaining older
spypoints, as the debugger will behave in the standard way,
according to the debugging mode. Still, such breakpoints may be
useful if they have side-effects, for example:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, -[parent_pred(P),</kbd>
                       <kbd>goal(G),</kbd>
                       <kbd>true(format('~q called from:~w~n',[G,P]))]).</kbd>
     % The debugger will first zip -- showing spypoints (zip)
     % Conditional spypoint for user:foo/2 added, BID=1
     true
     % zip
     | ?- <kbd>foo(3,X).</kbd>
     foo(2,_701) called from:bar/3
     foo(1,_1108) called from:bar/3
     foo(0,_1109) called from:bar/3
     foo(1,_702) called from:bar/3
     X = 2 ? <kbd>;</kbd>
     no
</pre>
   <p>This spypoint produces some output at ports of <code>foo/2</code>,
but otherwise will not influence the debugger. Notice that a
breakpoint spec with an empty test part can be written
<code>-</code><var>Actions</var>.

   <p>Let us look at some simple examples of what other effects can be achieved
by appropriate action variable settings:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, -[print,proceed]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>This is an example of an unleashed spypoint: it will print a
trace message passing each port of <code>foo/2</code>, but will not stop
there. Note that because of the <code>proceed</code> command a procedure
box will be built, even in zip mode, and so the debugger will be
activated at non-Call ports of <code>foo/2</code>.

   <p>The next example is a variant of the above:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, -[print,flit]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>This will print a trace message at the Call port of <code>foo/2</code>
and will then continue the execution in the current debugging mode,
without building a procedure box for this call. This means that
the debugger will not be able to notice any other ports of
<code>foo/2</code>.

   <p>Now let us address the task of stopping at a specific non-Call
port of a predicate. For this to work in zip mode, one
has to ensure that a procedure box is built at the Call
port. In the following example, the first spypoint causes a
box to be built for each call of <code>foo/2</code>, while the second one
makes the debugger stop when the Fail port of <code>foo/2</code> is
reached.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, call-proceed), spy(foo/2, fail).</kbd>
     % Conditional spypoint for user:foo/2 added, BID=1
     % Conditional spypoint for user:foo/2 added, BID=2
</pre>
   <p>You can achieve the same effect with a single spypoint, by putting
the <code>fail</code> condition (which is a shortcut for <code>port(fail)</code>) in
the <em>action</em> part, rather than in the <em>test</em> part.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, -[fail,print,ask]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>Here, when the execution reaches the Call port of <code>foo/2</code>,
the test part (which contains the <code>pred(foo/2)</code> condition only)
succeeds, so the breakpoint is found applicable.  However, the
action part fails at the Call port. This has a side-effect
in zip mode, as the default <code>flit</code> command representation is changed
to <code>proceed</code>. In other modes the action variables are
unaffected. The net result is that a procedure box is always built
for <code>foo/2</code>, which means that the debugger will actually reach the
Fail port of this predicate. When this happens, the action
part succeeds, and executing the actions <code>print,ask</code> will cause the
debugger to stop.

   <p>Note that we have to explicitly mention the <code>print,ask</code> actions
here, because the action part is otherwise nonempty (contains the
<code>fail</code> condition). It is only the empty or missing action part,
which is replaced by the default <code>[print,ask]</code>. If you want to
include a condition in the action part, you have to explicitly mention
all action variable settings you need.

   <p>To make this simpler, the debugger handles breakpoint condition
macros, which expand to other conditions. For example <code>leash</code> is a
macro that expands to <code>[print,ask]</code>. Consequently, the last example
can be simplified to:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, -[fail,leash]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, the macro <code>unleash</code> expands to <code>[print,proceed]</code>,
while <code>hide</code> to <code>[silent,proceed]</code>.

   <p>We now briefly describe further possible settings to the action
variables.

   <p>The <code>mode</code> variable can be assigned the values
<code>skip(</code><var>Inv</var><code>)</code> and <code>qskip(</code><var>Inv</var><code>)</code>, meaning skipping and
quasi-skipping until a port is reached whose invocation number is
less or equal to <var>Inv</var>. When the debugger arrives at this port
it sets the <code>mode</code> variable to <code>trace</code>.

   <p>It may be surprising that <code>skip(...)</code> is a mode, rather than a
command. This is because commands are executed and immediately
forgotten, but skipping has a lasting effect: the program is to be
run with no debugging until a specific point, without creating new
procedure boxes, and ignoring the existing ones in the meantime.

   <p>Here is an example using the <code>skip</code> mode:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2,call-[print,proceed,inv(Inv),skip(Inv)]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>This breakpoint will be found applicable at Call ports of
<code>foo/2</code>. It will print a trace message there and will skip over to
the Exit or Fail port without stopping. Notice that the number of
the current invocation is obtained in the action part, using the
<code>inv</code> condition with a variable argument. A variant of
this example follows:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2,-[silent,proceed,</kbd>
                            <kbd>(   call -&gt; inv(Inv), skip(Inv)</kbd>
                            <kbd>;   true</kbd>
                            <kbd>)]).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>This spypoint makes <code>foo/2</code> invisible in the output of the
debugger: at all ports we silently proceed (i.e. display nothing
and don't stop).  Furthermore, at the Call port we perform a
skip, so neither <code>foo/2</code> itself, nor any predicate called
within it will be shown by the debugger.

   <p>Notice the use of the <code>true/0</code> test in the above conditional!  This
is a breakpoint test that always succeeds.  The debugger also
recognizes <code>false</code> as a test that always fails. Note that while
<code>false</code> and <code>fail</code> are synonyms as built-in predicates,
they are completely different as breakpoint conditions: the latter
is a shortcut for <code>port(fail)</code>.

   <p>The <code>show</code> variable has four additional representation patterns. Setting it
to <code>display</code>, <code>write</code>, or <code>write_term(</code><var>Options</var><code>)</code>
will result in the debugged goal <var>G</var> being shown using
<code>display(</code><var>G</var><code>)</code>, <code>writeq(</code><var>G</var><code>)</code>, or
<code>write_term(</code><var>G</var><code>, </code><var>Options</var><code>)</code>, respectively. The fourth
pattern, <var>Method</var><code>-</code><var>Sel</var>, can be used for replacing the
goal in the trace message by one of its subterms, the one
pointed to by the selector <var>Sel</var>.

   <p>For example, the following spypoint instructs the debugger to stop
at each port of <code>foo/2</code>, and to only display the first
argument of <code>foo/2</code> in the trace message, instead of the
complete goal.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, -[print-[1],ask]).</kbd>
     % Conditional spypoint for user:foo/2 added, BID=1
     | ?- <kbd>foo(5,X).</kbd>
      *      1      1 Call: ^1 5 ?
</pre>
   <p>The <code>command</code> variable has several further representation patterns.  The
variable can be set to <code>proceed(</code><var>OldGoal</var><code>,</code><var>NewGoal</var><code>)</code>. At a
Call port this instructs the debugger to first build a
procedure box for the current goal, then to unify it
with <var>OldGoal</var> and finally execute <var>NewGoal</var> in its place (cf. 
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u</span></samp>&rsquo; (unify) interactive debugger command). At non-Call
ports this command first goes back to the Call port (cf. 
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; (retry) command), and then does the above activities.

   <p>A variant of the <code>proceed/2</code> command is
<code>flit(</code><var>OldGoal</var><code>,</code><var>NewGoal</var><code>)</code>. This has the same effect,
except for not building a procedure box for <var>OldGoal</var>.

   <p>We now just briefly list further command values (for the details, see
<a href="Action-Variables.html#Action-Variables">Action Variables</a>). Setting <code>command</code> to
<code>raise(</code><var>E</var><code>)</code> will raise an exception <var>E</var>, <code>abort</code>
will abort the execution. The values <code>retry(</code><var>Inv</var><code>)</code>,
<code>reexit(</code><var>Inv</var><code>)</code>, <code>redo(</code><var>Inv</var><code>)</code>, <code>fail(</code><var>Inv</var><code>)</code>
will cause the debugger to go back to an earlier Call, Exit, Redo, or
Fail port with invocation number <var>Inv</var> (cf. the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">j</span></samp>&rsquo;
(jump) interactive debugger command).

   <p>Sometimes it may be useful to access the representation of an action
variable. This can be done with the <code>get</code> condition: e.g. 
<code>get(mode(M))</code> will unify <code>M</code> with the current execution
mode. The <code>get(...)</code> wrapper can be omitted in the test part,
but not in the action part (since there a <code>mode(M)</code> action will
set, rather than read, the mode action variable).  For example:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>spy(foo/2, mode(trace)-show(print-[1])).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>This spypoint will be found applicable only in trace mode
(and will cause the first argument of <code>foo/2</code> to appear in
the trace message). (The <code>mode</code> and <code>show</code> wrappers can also
be omitted in the above example, they are used only to help with interpreting
the breakpoint spec.)
