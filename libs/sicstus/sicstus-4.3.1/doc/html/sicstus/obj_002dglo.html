<h4 class="subsection">10.22.7 Glossary</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>abstract class</dfn><dd>A class that cannot have instances. Abstract classes
are helpful in designing a class hierarchy, to contain the common parts
of several concrete classes.

     <br><dt><dfn>ancestor</dfn><dd>One of a class's superclasses, one of its superclasses's
superclasses, etc. Sometimes, for convenience, ancestor includes the
class itself, along with its proper ancestors.

     <br><dt><dfn>child</dfn><dd>A synonym for subclass.

     <br><dt><dfn>class</dfn><dd>A class is defined by a description of the information its
instances contain and the messages they respond to. 
Every object is an instance of one and only one class.

     <br><dt><dfn>concrete class</dfn><dd>A class that can have instances. Most classes are concrete.

     <br><dt><dfn>create method</dfn><dd>Specifies what actions should be taken when an instance
of a class is created. A create method frequently
provides initial slot values or specifies an action to be
performed by the new object. A create message is sent to
each new object by the <code>create/2</code> predicate. A create
message is a kind of send message.

     <br><dt><dfn>descendant</dfn><dd>One of a class's subclasses, one of its subclasses's
subclasses, etc. Sometimes the word descendant
includes the class itself, along with its proper descendants.

     <br><dt><dfn>destroy method</dfn><dd>Specifies what actions should be taken when an instance
of a class is destroyed. A destroy message is sent to an
object by the <code>destroy/1</code> predicate. A destroy message
is a kind of send message.

     <br><dt><dfn>direct slot access</dfn><dd>Fetching or storing a slot representation without sending a
message to the object. This should be used with care!

     <p>SICStus Objects allows direct access to a class's slots
only within its method definitions, via the
<code>fetch_slot/2</code> and <code>store_slot/2</code> predicates.

     <br><dt><dfn>get message</dfn><dd>A message that inquires about some aspect of an object. 
Typically used to fetch slot values. Get methods are
automatically generated for public slots. Get messages
are written with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator.

     <br><dt><dfn>inheritance</dfn><dd>The process by which a class's slots and methods are
determined from an ancestor.

     <br><dt><dfn>initial representation</dfn><dd>The representation a slot is initialized to when an object is
created. Every slot has a default initial representation, which
depends upon its type. You may specify different initial
values in a class definition.

     <br><dt><dfn>instance</dfn><dd>Another word for object. The word instance draws
attention to the class of which the object is an instance.

     <br><dt><dfn>instance method</dfn><dd>A method that may be defined differently for each
instance of a class. The class may have a default method
for this message, which is overridden by installing an
instance method for a particular object.

     <br><dt><dfn>message</dfn><dd>A command to an object to perform an operation or to
modify itself, or an inquiry into some aspect of the object. 
In SICStus Objects, a message is either a get message, a
put message or a send message. The syntax for sending
a message to an object is

     <pre class="example">          <var>Object</var> <var>Operator</var> <var>Message</var>
</pre>
     <br><dt><dd>
where <var>Operator</var> is one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt><code>&gt;&gt;</code><dd>get message

          <br><dt><code>&lt;&lt;</code><dd>put message

          <br><dt><code>&lt;-</code><dd>send message
</dl>

     <br><dt><dfn>method</dfn><dd>A class's implementation of a particular message. You
send messages to an object, but you define methods for
a class.

     <br><dt><dfn>method clause</dfn><dd>A Prolog clause used to define a method for a class. A
method clause has one of <code>&lt;-/2</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;/2</code> or <code>&gt;&gt;/2</code> as the
principal functor of its head, and it can only appear
within the scope of its class's definition. A method's
definition may contain more than one message clause.

     <br><dt><dfn>mixin class</dfn><dd>A class that is intended to be combined (mixed in) with
other classes, via multiple inheritance, to define new subclasses.

     <br><dt><dfn>multiple inheritance</dfn><dd>When a class names more than one superclass. 
Typically, it inherits slots and methods from each. 
In SICStus Objects, two different superclasses should
not use the same slot name. And, if a message is defined
by more than one superclass, the class definition must
specify which method to inherit.

     <br><dt><dfn>object</dfn><dd>A modifiable data item that holds information and
responds to messages. Another word for instance.

     <br><dt><dfn>parent class</dfn><dd>A synonym for superclass.

     <br><dt><dfn>private slot</dfn><dd>A private slot is, by default, only accessible within
methods of the class itself.  Not even the descendants of the class
may access its private slots, except through the class's methods. Get and
put methods are not automatically generated for a
private slot, so it is only accessed via the methods you
define. If the visibility of a slot is not specified, it is private,
rather than public or protected.

     <br><dt><dfn>protected slot</dfn><dd>A protected slot is, by default, only accessible within
methods of the class itself and its descendants. Get and
put methods are not automatically generated for a
protected slot, so it is only accessed via the methods you
define. If the visibility of a slot is not specified, it is private,
rather than public or protected. 
<br><dt><dd>
SICStus Objects <code>protected</code> is similar to <code>protected</code> in C++.

     <br><dt><dfn>public slot</dfn><dd>A public slot is accessible via its own get
and put methods, which are generated for it
automatically. If no visibility is specified, a slot is
private, rather than public or protected.

     <br><dt><dfn>put message</dfn><dd>A message that modifies some aspect of an object. 
Typically used to store slot values. Put methods are
automatically generated for public slots. Put messages
are written with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; operator.

     <br><dt><dfn>send message</dfn><dd>The most common sort of message. Used for performing
an operation on an object or for performing an action
that depends upon an object. Send messages are written
with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo; operator.

     <br><dt><dfn>send super</dfn><dd>When a method for a class executes a shadowed
superclass's method. This allows a class to put a
&ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; around its superclass's method, making it
unnecessary to duplicate the method just to make a small extension to it.

     <br><dt><dfn>shadow</dfn><dd>When a class defines its own method for a message
defined by one of its ancestors, the new method hides or
&ldquo;shadows&rdquo; the ancestor's method. The new class's
descendants will inherit its method for that message,
rather than its ancestors. That is, a class always inherits
the &ldquo;closer&rdquo; of two methods for a message.

     <br><dt><dfn>slot</dfn><dd>A part of an instance that holds an individual datum. 
Like a member of a C struct or a field of a Pascal record.

     <br><dt><dfn>subclass</dfn><dd>A class that is a more specific case of a particular class. 
This is the opposite of superclass. A class does not name
its subclasses; they are inferred.

     <br><dt><dfn>superclass</dfn><dd>A class that is a more general case of a particular class. 
Each class lists its superclasses.

     <br><dt><dfn>term class</dfn><dd>A class whose instances are represented as ordinary Prolog
terms.  The functor of these objects need not be the name of the
class, and the arity need not be one.

     <br><dt><dfn>term slot</dfn><dd>A slot that can hold any Prolog term.

     <br><dt><dfn>uninherit</dfn><dd>Specify that a method from a superclass should not be
inherited. This is similar to shadowing the superclass's
method, but does not specify a replacement for it.

     <br><dt><dfn>visibility</dfn><dd>A slot may be defined to be either <code>public</code>,
<code>protected</code>, or <code>private</code>.  By default, if no visibility is
specified, a slot is private.
