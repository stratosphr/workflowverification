<h5 class="subsubsection">10.22.3.1 Single Inheritance</h5>

<p>The simplest case is when a new class inherits some properties (slots
and methods) from a single superclass. That superclass may, in turn,
be defined in terms of its superclass, etc. The new class, its
superclass, its superclass's superclass (if any) and so on are all
ancestors of the new class.

<h4 class="subheading">Class Definitions</h4>

<p>The definition of a class with a single superclass begins with a <code>class/1</code>
directive of the form

<pre class="example">     :- class <var>ClassName</var> = [<var>SlotDef</var>, <var><small class="dots">...</small></var>] +  <var>SuperClass</var>.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the list of <var>SlotDef</var> descriptions may be empty. In that case,
the definition can simplified to

<pre class="example">     :- class <var>ClassName</var> = <var>SuperClass</var>.
</pre>
   <p>The class <var>SuperClass</var> must be a defined class when this definition is given.

   <p>In SICStus Objects, a subclass inherits all the slots of its
superclass. And, by default, it inherits all the methods of its
superclass. The remainder of this section describes what the
programmer can do to control this inheritance.

<h4 class="subheading">Slots</h4>

<p>A class's slots are a combination of those explicitly defined in its
slot description list and the slots it inherits from its
superclass. In SICStus Objects, a class inherits all the slots of its
superclass. It follows that a class inherits all the slots of all its
ancestors.

   <p>The programmer's control over inheritance of slots is limited. It is
not possible to rename an inherited slot, nor is it possible to change
its type, unless it is a class slot. It is possible to change a slot's
initial representation. And, it is possible to effectively change a slot's
visibility.

   <p>To change the initial representation or the type (when allowed) of a slot,
include a new <var>SlotDef</var> in the list of slot descriptions for the class,
with the same slot name and a new type or initial representation. The type of a
class slot
can only be changed to a subclass of the type of the superclass's
slot. The new initial representation must still be a constant of the
appropriate type.

   <p>The <code>named_point</code> class, defined earlier, could have better been defined
from the point class, which began as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class point =
             [public x:float=0,
              public y:float=0].
</pre>
   <p>The definition of the <code>named_point</code> class would then begin with

<pre class="example">     :- class named_point =
             [public name:atom,
              public x:float=1.0] + point.
</pre>
   <p>This <code>named_point</code> class has public slots named <code>name</code>, <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>, with the same types and initial values as the earlier
<code>named_point</code> definition, which did not use inheritance.  This
<code>named_point</code> class also inherits all the methods of the <code>point</code>
class, which saves us from having to write them again (and maintain them).

   <p>A slot that was private or protected in a superclass may be defined as
public. This will cause get and put methods to be generated in the
subclass. A slot that was public in a superclass may be defined as
protected or private, but this does not prevent it from inheriting the get and
put methods of the superclass. For that, the <code>uninherit/1</code>
directive, defined below, is
needed.

<h4 class="subheading">Methods</h4>

<p>In SICStus Objects, by default, a class inherits all the methods of
its superclass. The programmer has more control over the inheritance
of methods than the inheritance of slots, however. In particular,
methods can be uninherited and they can be redefined.

   <p>To prevent a method from being inherited, use the <code>uninherit/1</code>
directive. For example, suppose that the class <code>point</code> is defined as
before. That is, its definition begins as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class point =
             [public x:float=0,
              public y:float=0].
</pre>
   <p>Because both slots are public, a put method is automatically generated
for each, which allows their values to be changed.

   <p>The definition of a new class <code>fixed_point</code> might begin as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class fixed_point = point.
     
     :- uninherit
             point &lt;&lt; (x/l),
             point &lt;&lt; (y/l).
     
     Self &lt;- create(X, Y) :-
             store_slot(x, X),
             store_slot(y, Y).
</pre>
   <p>The parentheses are necessary because of the precedences of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; operators.

   <p>Because the put methods from <code>point</code> are not inherited, no instance of
the <code>fixed_point</code> class can change its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values once
created&mdash;unless the class definition contains another method for doing
so. The get methods are inherited from <code>point</code>, however.

   <p>To redefine a method, simply include method clauses for its message
within a class's definition. The new method clauses replace, or
shadow, the inherited method clauses for this class.

   <p>Another way to prevent the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots of the
<code>fixed_point</code> class from being modified would be to shadow the put
methods. For example, they might be redefined as

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;&lt; x(_) :-
             format(user_error, "cannot modify x slot representation.~n.", []),
             fail.
     
     Self &lt;&lt; y(_) :-
             format(user_error, "cannot modify y slot representation.~n", []),
             fail.
</pre>
   <p>Now attempts to modify the <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> values of a fixed point
object generate a specific error message and fail.  A more complicated
version would raise an appropriate exception.

<h4 class="subheading">Send Super</h4>

<p>Even when a superclass's method is shadowed or uninherited, it is
possible to use the superclass's method inside a method clause for the
new class. This makes it possible to define a &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; for the
superclass's method, which invokes the superclass's method without
having to duplicate its code. This
technique works with all message types.

   <p>Sending a message to a superclass is done with a command of the form

<pre class="example">     <code>super</code> <var>MessageOp</var> <var>Message</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>MessageOp</var> is one of the message operators (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo;) and <var>Message</var> is a message defined for the superclass.  A
generalization of this syntax may be used to specify which superclass
to send the message to.  This is discussed in <a href="obj_002dinh_002dmih.html#obj_002dinh_002dmih">obj-inh-mih</a>.

   <p>Sending a message to a class's superclass can only be done within a
message clause.
