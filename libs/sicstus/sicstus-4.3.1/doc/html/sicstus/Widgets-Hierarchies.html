<h5 class="subsubsection">10.37.3.3 Widgets Hierarchies</h5>

<p>Before going further it is necessary to understand how instances of
widgets are named.  Widgets are arranged in a hierarchy. The names of
widget instances are formed from dot separated words.  The root window
is simply <code>.</code> on its own.  So for, example, a button widget that
is displayed in the root window might have the name <code>.b1</code>.  A
button that is displayed inside a frame that is displayed inside the
root window may have the name <code>.frame1.b1</code>.  The frame would have
the name <code>.frame1</code>.

   <p>Following this notation, it is clear that widgets are both
formed in hierarchies, with the dot notation giving the path to
a widget, and in groups, all widgets with the same leading path
are notionaly in the same group.

   <p>(It is a similar to the way file systems are organized. 
 A file has a path that shows where to find it in the hierarchical
 file system. But also files with the same leading path are in the same
 directory/folder and so are notionaly grouped together.)

   <p>An instance of a widget is created through the a Tcl command for that
widget.  The widget command my have optional arguments set for
specifying various attributes of the widget that it will have when it is
created.  The result of a successful widget command is the name of the
new widget.

   <p>For example, a command to create a button widget named <code>.mybutton</code>
that displays the text &ldquo;I am a button&rdquo; would look like this:

<pre class="example">     button .mybutton -text "I am a button"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and this will return the name <code>.mybutton</code>.

   <p>A widget will only be created if all the windows/widgets
in the leading path of the new widget also exist, and also that the
name of the new widget does not already exist.

   <p>For example, the following

<pre class="example">     button .mybutton -text "I am a button"
     button .mybutton -text "and so am I"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will fail at the second command because there is also a widget named
<code>.mybutton</code> from the first command.

   <p>The following will also fail

<pre class="example">     button .frame.mybutton -text "I am a button"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if there is no existing widget with the name <code>.frame</code> to be the parent
of <code>.mybutton</code>.

   <p>All this begs the question: why are widgets named and arranged in
a hierarchy? Isn't a GUI just a bunch of widgets displayed
in a window?

   <p>This is not generally how GUIs are arranged. 
For example, they often have a menubar over the top of each window. 
The menubar contains pulldown menus. The pulldown menus may have
cascading menu items that may cascade down several levels. 
Under the menu bar is the main part of the window that may
also be split into several &ldquo;frames&rdquo;. A left hand frame my have
a set of buttons in it, for example. And so on. 
From this you can see that the widgets in GUIs are naturally
arranged in a hierarchy. To achieve this in Tcl/Tk
instances of widgets are placed in a hierarchy, which is reflected in their
names.

   <p>Now we will go through each of the widget commands in turn. 
Each widget command has many options most of which will not
be described here. Just enough will be touched on for the reader
to understand the basic operation of each widget. 
For a complete description of each widget and
its many options refer to the Tk manual.
