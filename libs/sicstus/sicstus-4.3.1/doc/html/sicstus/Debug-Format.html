<h3 class="section">5.4 Format of Debugging Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-debugging-messages-1900"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-debugging-1901"></a>
We shall now look at the exact format of the message output by the
system at a port.  All trace messages are output to the standard
error stream, using the <code>print_message/2</code> predicate;
see <a href="ref_002dmsg.html#ref_002dmsg">ref-msg</a>.  This allows you to trace programs
while they are performing file I/O.  The basic format is as follows:

<pre class="example">     <var>N</var> <var>S</var>    23     <var>F</var>6 Call: <var>T</var> foo(hello,there,_123) ?
</pre>
   <p><var>N</var> is only used at Exit ports and indicates whether the
invocation could backtrack and find alternative solutions. 
Unintended nondeterminacy is a source of inefficiency, and this
annotation can help spot such efficiency bugs.  It is printed as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, indicating that <code>foo/3</code> could backtrack and find
alternative solutions, or &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo; otherwise.

   <p><var>S</var> is a spypoint indicator.  If there is a plain
spypoint on <code>foo/3</code>, it is printed as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;. In case of
conditional and generic spypoints it takes the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively. Finally, it is printed as &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo;, if there is
no spypoint on the predicate being traced.

   <p>The first number is the unique invocation identifier.  It is increasing
regardless of whether or not debugging messages are output for the
invocations (provided that the debugger is switched on).  This number
can be used to cross correlate the trace messages for the various
ports, since it is unique for every invocation.  It will also give
an indication of the number of procedure calls made since the
start of the execution.  The invocation counter starts again for every
fresh execution of a command, and it is also reset when retries (see
later) are performed.

   <p><a name="index-current-frame-1902"></a><a name="index-frame_002c-current-1903"></a>Just before the second number is an optional <dfn>frame marker</dfn>, printed
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; if present.  This marks the location of the current frame,
the meaning of which is explained in the next section.

   <p><a name="index-ancestor-goal-1904"></a><a name="index-goal_002c-ancestor-1905"></a>The second number is the <dfn>current depth</dfn>; i.e. the number
of direct ancestors this goal has, for which a
procedure box has been built by the debugger.

   <p>The next word specifies the particular port (Call, Exit, Redo,
Fail, or Exception).

   <p><var>T</var> is a subterm trace.  This is used in conjunction with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; command (set subterm), described below.  If a subterm has been
selected, <var>T</var> is printed as the sequence of commands used to select
the subterm.  Normally, however, <var>T</var> is printed as &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo;,
indicating that no subterm has been selected.

   <p>The goal is then printed so that you can inspect its current
instantiation state.

   <p>The final &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; is the prompt indicating that you should type in one
of the commands allowed (see <a href="Debug-Commands.html#Debug-Commands">Debug Commands</a>).  If this particular
port is unleashed, you will not get this prompt since
you have specified that you don't wish to interact at this point.

   <p>At Exception ports, the trace message is preceded by a message
about the pending exception, formatted as if it would arrive uncaught at
the top-level.

   <p>Note that calls that are compiled inline
<!-- and built-in -->
<!-- predicates at depth 1 (e.g.@: those called directly from the top-level) -->
are not traced.

   <p>Block and Unblock ports are exceptions to the above debugger message
format.  A message

<pre class="example">            <var>S</var> -  -  Block: p(_133)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-blocked-goal-1906"></a><a name="index-goal_002c-blocked-1907"></a>indicates that the debugger has encountered a blocked goal,
i.e. one which is temporarily suspended due to insufficiently
instantiated arguments (see <a href="ref_002dsem_002dsec.html#ref_002dsem_002dsec">ref-sem-sec</a>).  By default, no
interaction takes place at this point, and the debugger simply proceeds
to the next goal in the execution stream.  The suspended
goal will be eligible for execution once the blocking
condition ceases to exist, at which time a message

<pre class="example">            <var>S</var> -  -  Unblock: p(_133)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is printed. Although Block and Unblock ports are unleashed
by default in trace mode, you can make the debugger interact at
these ports by using conditional spypoints.
