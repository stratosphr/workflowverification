<h5 class="subsubsection">10.37.5.1 Tcl The Master, Prolog The Slave</h5>

<p>This is the classical way that GUIs are bolted onto applications. 
The slave (in this case Prolog) sits mostly idle while the user
interacts with the GUI, for example filling in a form. 
When some action happens in the GUI that requires information from the
slave (a form submit, for example), the slave is called, performs
a calculation, and the GUI retrieves the result and updates its display
accordingly.

   <p>In our Prolog+Tcl/Tk setting this involves the following steps:

     <ul>
<li>start Prolog and load the Tcl/Tk library
<li>load Prolog application code
<li>start a Tcl/Tk interpreter through <code>tk_new/2</code>
<li>set up the Tk GUI through calls to <code>tcl_eval/3</code>
<li>pass control to Tcl/Tk through <code>tk_main_loop</code>
</ul>

   <p>Some of The Tk widgets in the GUI will have &ldquo;callbacks&rdquo; to Prolog,
i.e. they will call the <code>prolog</code> Tcl command.  When the Prolog call
returns, the values stored in the <code>prolog_variables</code> array in the
Tcl interpreter can then be used by Tcl to update the display.

   <p>Here is a simple example of a callback. The Prolog part is this:

<pre class="example">     :- use_module(library(tcltk)).
     
     hello('world').
     
     go :-
         tk_new([], Tcl),
         tcl_eval(Tcl, 'source simple.tcl', _),
         tk_main_loop.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which just loads the <code>library(tcltk)</code>, defines a
<code>hello/1</code> data clause, and <code>go/0</code>, which starts a new
Tcl/Tk interpreter, loads the code <code>simple.tcl</code> into it, and passes
control to Tcl/Tk.

   <p>The Tcl part, <code>simple.tcl</code>, is this:

<pre class="example">     label .l -textvariable tvar
     button .b -text "push me" -command { call_and_display }
     pack .l .b -side top
     
     proc call_and_display { } {
         global tvar
     
         prolog "hello(X)"
         set tvar $prolog_variables(X)
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which creates a label, with an associated text variable, and a button,
that has a call back procedure, <code>call_and_display</code>, attached to it. 
When the button is pressed, <code>call_and_display</code> is executed, which
simply evaluates the goal <code>hello(X)</code> in Prolog and the text
variable of the label <code>.l</code> to whatever <code>X</code> becomes bound
to, which happens to be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">world</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In short, pressing the button
causes the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">world</span></samp>&rsquo; to be displayed in the label.

   <p>Having Tcl as the master and Prolog as the slave, although a simple
model to understand and implement, does have disadvantages.  The Tcl
command <code>prolog</code> is determinate, i.e. it can return only
one result with no backtracking.  If more than one result is
needed it means either performing some kind of all-solutions search and
returning a list of results for Tcl to process, or asserting a
clause into the Prolog clause store reflecting the state of
the computation.

   <p>Here is an example of how an all-solutions search can be done. It is a
program that calculates the outcome of certain ancestor
relationships; i.e. enter the name of a person, click on a button and
it will tell you the mother, father, parents or ancestors of that
person.

   <p>The Prolog portion looks like this
(see also <code>library('tcltk/examples/ancestors.pl')</code>):

<pre class="example">     :- use_module(library(tcltk)).
     
     go :- tk_new([name('ancestors')], X),
         tcl_eval(X, 'source ancestors.tcl', _),
         tk_main_loop,
         tcl_delete(X).
     
     father(ann, fred).
     father(fred, jim).
     mother(ann, lynn).
     mother(fred, lucy).
     father(jim, sam).
     
     parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).
     parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).
     
     ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
     ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
     
     all_ancestors(X, Z) :- findall(Y, ancestor(X, Y), Z).
     
     all_parents(X, Z) :-   findall(Y, parent(X, Y), Z).
</pre>
   <p>This program consists of three parts.  The first part is defined
by <code>go/0</code>, the now familiar way in which a Prolog program can
create a Tcl/Tk interpreter, load a Tcl file into that interpreter, and
pass control over to the interpreter.

   <p>The second part is a small database of mother/father relationships
between certain people through the clauses <code>mother/2</code> and
<code>father/2</code>.

   <p>The third part is a set of &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for determining certain relationships
between people: <code>parent/2</code>, <code>ancestor/2</code>,
<code>all_ancestors/2</code> and <code>all_parents/2</code>.

   <p>The Tcl part looks like this
(see also <code>library('tcltk/examples/ancestors.tcl')</code>):

<div align="center">Ancestors Calculator</div>

<p>This program is in two parts.  The first part sets up the Tk
display, which consists of four radiobuttons to choose the kind of
relationship we want to calculate, an entry box to put the name of the
person we want to calculate the relationship over, and a label in which
to display the result.

   <p>Each radio buttons has an associated callback. Clicking on the
radio button will invoke the appropriate callback,
apply the appropriate relationship to the name entered in the
text entry box, and display the result in the results label.

   <p>The second part consists of the callback procedures themselves. 
There are actually just two of them: one for a single solution
calculation, and one for an all-solutions calculation. 
The single solution callback is used when we want to know the
mother or father as we know that a person can have only
one of each. The all-solutions callback is used when we want to
know the parents or ancestors as we know that these
can return more than one results. 
(We could have used the all-solutions callback for the single solutions cases too, but we would like to illustrate the difference in the two approaches.) 
There is little difference between the two approaches, except that in
the single solution callback, it is possible that the call to Prolog
will fail, so we wrap it in an <code>if</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>else</code> construct to
catch this case.  An all-solutions search, however, cannot fail, and so
the <code>if</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>else</code> is not needed.

   <p>But there are some technical problems too with this approach. 
During a callback Tk events are not serviced until the callback
returns. For Prolog callbacks that take a very short time to complete
this is not a problem, but in other cases, for example during a long search
call when the callback takes a significant time to complete, this can cause
problems. Imagine that, in our example, we had a vast
database describing the parent relationships of millions of people. 
Performing an all-solutions ancestors search could take a long time. 
The classic problem is that the GUI no longer reacts to
the user until the callback completes.

   <p>The solution to this is to sprinkle <code>tk_do_one_event/[0,1]</code> calls
throughout the critical parts of the Prolog code, to keep various
kinds of Tk events serviced.

   <p>If this method is used in its purest form, it is recommended that
after initialization and passing of control to Tcl, Prolog don't make
calls to Tcl through <code>tcl_eval/3</code>. This is to avoid programming
spaghetti. In the pure master/slave relationship it is a general principle
that the master only call the slave, and not the other way around.
