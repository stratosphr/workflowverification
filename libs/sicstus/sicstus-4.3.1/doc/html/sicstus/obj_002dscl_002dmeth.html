<h5 class="subsubsection">10.22.2.3 Methods</h5>

<p>Some methods are defined by method clauses, between the
<code>class/1</code> directive and the end of the class's definition. Others
are generated automatically. There are three kinds of messages in
SICStus Objects, distinguished by the message operator they occur
with:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A get message, which is typically used to fetch values from an object's slots.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A put message, which is typically used to store values in an object's slots.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A send message, which is used for other operations on or involving an object. 
</dl>

   <p>SICStus Objects automatically generates some get and put methods. And,
it expects particular message names with the send operator for create
and destroy methods. For the most part, however, you are free to use
any message operators and any message names that seem appropriate.

   <p>A method clause has one of these message operators as the principal
functor of its head. Its first argument, written to the left of the
message operator, is a variable. By convention, we use the variable
<code>Self</code>. Its second argument, written to the right of the message
operator, is a term whose functor is the name of the message and whose
arguments are its arguments.

   <p>For example, in the class whose definition begins as follows, a
0-argument send message named <code>increment</code> is defined. No parentheses are
needed in the clause head, because the precedence of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;-</span></samp>&rsquo; message
operator is lower than that of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:-</span></samp>&rsquo; operator.

<pre class="example">     :- class counter = [public count:integer = 0].
     
     Self &lt;- increment :-
             Self &gt;&gt; count (X0),
             X1 is X0 + 1,
             Self &lt;&lt; count (X1).
</pre>
   <p>Its definition uses the automatically generated get and put methods
for the public slot <code>count</code>.

   <p>It may look as though this technique is directly adding clauses to the
<code>&gt;&gt;/2</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;/2</code> and <code>&lt;-/2</code> predicates, but the method clauses are
transformed by term expansion, at compile time.  However, the method
clauses have the effect of extending the definitions of those
predicates.

   <p>Methods are defined by Prolog clauses, so it is possible for them to
fail, like Prolog predicates, and it is possible for them to be
nondeterminate, producing multiple answers, upon backtracking. The
rest of this section describes different kinds of methods.

<h4 class="subheading">Get and Put Methods</h4>

<p>Get and put methods are generated automatically for each of a class's
public slots. These are 1-argument messages, named after the slots.

   <p>In the point class whose definition begins with

<pre class="example">     :- class point =
             [public x:float=0,
              public y:float=0].
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the get and put methods are automatically generated for the <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> slots. If the class defines a <code>create/0</code> method, the command

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(point, PointObj),
          PointObj &gt;&gt;  x(OldX),
          PointObj &gt;&gt;  y(OldY),
          PointObj &lt;&lt;  x(3.14159),
          PointObj &lt;&lt;  y(2.71828).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">creates a point object and binds both <code>OldX</code> and <code>OldY</code> to
0.0E+00, its initial slot values. Then, it changes the values of the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots to 3.14159 and 2.71828, respectively. The
variable <code>PointObj</code> is bound to the point object.

   <p>It is possible, and sometimes quite useful, to create get and put
methods for slots that don't exist. For example, it is possible to
add a polar coordinate interface to the point class by defining
get and put methods for <code>r</code> and <code>theta</code>, even though there are no
<code>r</code> and <code>theta</code> slots. The get methods might be defined as
follows:

<pre class="example">     Self &gt;&gt; r(R) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; x(X),
             Self &gt;&gt; y(Y),
             R is sqrt(X*X + Y*Y).
     
     Self &gt;&gt; theta(T) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; x(X),
             Self &gt;&gt; y(Y),
             T is atan(Y/X).
</pre>
   <p>The put methods are left as an exercise.

   <p>In the rational number class whose definition begins with:

<pre class="example">     :- class rational =
             [public num:integer,
              public denom:integer].
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">get and put methods are automatically generated for the <code>num</code> and <code>denom</code>
slots. It might be reasonable to add a get method for <code>float</code>, which
would provide a floating point approximation to the rational in
response to that get message. This is left as an exercise.

   <p>It is also possible to define get and put methods that take more than
one argument. For example, it would be useful to have a put method for
the point class that sets both slots of a point object. Such a method
could be defined by

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;&lt; point(X,Y) :-
             Self &lt;&lt; x(X),
             Self &lt;&lt; y(Y).
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, a 2-argument get method for the rational number class might
be defined as

<pre class="example">     Self &gt;&gt; (N/D) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; num(N),
             Self &gt;&gt; denom(D).
</pre>
   <p>Note that the name of the put message is <code>(/)/2</code>, and that the
parentheses are needed because of the relative
precedences of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;
operators.

   <p>Put messages are used to store values in slots. Get messages, however,
may be used either to fetch a representation from a slot or to test whether a
particular representation is in a slot. For instance, the following command
tests whether the <code>do_something/2</code> predicate sets the point
object's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots to 3.14159 and 2.71828, respectively.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(point, PointObj),
          do_something(PointObj),
          PointObj &gt;&gt; x(3.14159),
          PointObj &gt;&gt; y(2.71828).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>The <code>fetch_slot/2</code> predicate can similarly be used to test the representation
of a slot.

   <p>The effects of a put message (indeed, of any message) are not undone
upon backtracking. For example, the following command fails:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(point, PointObj),
          PointObj &lt;&lt; x(3.14159),
          PointObj &lt;&lt; y(2.71828),
          fail.</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>But, it leaves behind a point object with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots
containing the values 3.14159 and 2.71828, respectively. In this,
storing a representation in an object's slot resembles storing a term in the
Prolog database with <code>assert/1</code>.

   <p>Some care is required when storing Prolog terms containing unbound
variables in term slots.  For example, given the class definition that
begins with

<pre class="example">     :- class prolog_term = [public p_term:term].
     
     Self &lt;- create.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the following command would succeed:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(prolog_term, TermObj),
          TermObj &lt;&lt; p_term(foo(X,Y)),
          X = a,
          Y = b,
          TermObj &gt;&gt; p_term(foo(c,d)).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>The reason is that the free variables in <code>foo(X,Y)</code> are renamed when the
term is stored in the <code>prolog_term</code> object's <code>p_term</code> slot. This is
similar to what happens when such a term is asserted to the Prolog
database:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>retractall(foo(_,_)),
          assert(foo(X,Y)),
          X = a,
          Y = b,
          foo(c,d).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>However, this goal would fail, because <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> cannot be unified:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(prolog_term, TermObj),
          TermObj &lt;&lt; p_term(foo(X,X)),
          TermObj &gt;&gt; p_term(foo(c,d)).</kbd>
</pre>
   <h4 class="subheading">Direct Slot Access</h4>

<p>Get and put methods are not automatically generated for private and protected
slots. Those slots are accessed by the <code>fetch_slot/2</code> and
<code>store_slot/2</code> predicates, which may only appear in the body of a
method clause and which always operate on the object to which the
message is sent. It is not possible to access the slots of another
object with these predicates.

   <p>You may declare a slot to be private or protected in order to limit access to
it. However, it is still possible, and frequently useful, to define
get and put methods for such a slot.

   <p>For example, if numerator and denominator slots of the rational number
class were
private rather than public, it would be possible to define put
methods to ensure that the denominator is never 0 and that the
numerator and denominator are relatively prime. The get methods merely
fetch slot values, but they need to be defined explicitly, since the
slots are private. The new definition of the rational number class
might start as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class rational =
             [num:integer=0,
              denom:integer=1].
     
     Self &gt;&gt; num(N) :-
             fetch_slot(num, N).
     
     Self &gt;&gt; denom(D) :-
             fetch_slot(denom, D).
     
     Self &gt;&gt; (N/D) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; num(N),
             Self &gt;&gt; denom(D).
</pre>
   <p>One of the put methods for the class might be

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;&lt; num(NO) :-
             fetch_slot(denom, DO)
             reduce(NO, DO, N, D),
             store_slot(num, N),
             store_slot(denom, D).
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the <code>reduce/4</code> predicate would be defined to divide <code>NO</code> and
<code>DO</code> by their greatest common divisor, producing <code>N</code> and <code>D</code>,
respectively.

   <p>The definition of <code>reduce/4</code> and the remaining put methods is left
as an exercise.  The put methods should fail for any message that
attempts to set the denominator to 0.

<h4 class="subheading">Send Methods</h4>

<p>Messages that do something more than fetch or store slot values are
usually defined as send messages. While the choice of message
operators is (usually) up to the programmer, choosing them carefully
enhances the readability of a program.

   <p>For example, print methods might be defined for the point and rational
number classes, respectively, as

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- print(Stream) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; x(X),
             Self &gt;&gt; y(Y),
             format(Stream, "(~w,~w)", [X, Y]).
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- print(Stream) :-
             fetch_slot(num, N),
             fetch_slot(denom, D),
             format(Stream, "~w/~w", [N, D]).
</pre>
   <p>These methods are used to access slot values. But, the fact that the
values are printed to an output stream makes it more reasonable to
define them as send messages than get messages.

   <p>Frequently send methods modify slot values. For example, the point
class might have methods that flip points around the x and y axes,
respectively:

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- flip_x :-
             Self &gt;&gt; y(Y0),
             Y1 is -1 * Y0,
             Self &lt;&lt; y(Y1).
     
     Self &lt;- flip_y :-
             Self &gt;&gt; x(X0),
             X1 is -1 * X0,
             Self &lt;&lt; x(X1).
</pre>
   <p>And, the rational number class might have a method that swaps the
numerator and denominator of a rational number object. It fails if the
numerator is 0.

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- invert :-
             fetch_slot(num, N)
             N =\= 0,
             fetch_slot(denom, D)
             store_slot(num, D),
             store_slot(denom, N).
</pre>
   <p>These methods modify slot values, but they don't simply store values
that are given in the message. Hence, it is more reasonable to use the
send operator.

   <p>It is possible for a method to produce more than one answer. For
example, the class whose definition begins with

<pre class="example">     :- class interval =
             [public lower:integer,
              public upper:integer].
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">might define a send method

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- in_interval(X) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; lower(L),
             Self &gt;&gt; upper(U),
             between(L, U, X).
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which uses the <code>between/3</code> predicate from <code>library(between)</code>. The
<code>in_interval</code> message will bind <code>X</code> to each integer, one at a time,
between the lower and upper slots, inclusive. It fails if asked for
too many answers.

   <p>The rest of this section describes particular kinds of send messages.

<h4 class="subheading">Create and Destroy Methods</h4>

<!-- label create-destroy -->
<p>Objects are created with the <code>create/2</code> predicate. When you define a
class, you must specify all the ways that instances of the class can
be created. The simplest creation method is defined as

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- create.
</pre>
   <p>If this method were defined for <var>Class</var>, the command

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(</kbd><var>Class</var><kbd>, </kbd><code>Object</code><kbd>).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would create an instance of <var>Class</var> and bind the variable <code>Object</code> to that
instance. All slots would receive their (possibly default) initial
values.

   <p>More generally, if the definition for <var>Class</var> contains a create method

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- create(<var>Arguments</var>) :-
             <var>Body</var>.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the command

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(</kbd><var>Class</var><kbd>(</kbd><var>Arguments</var><kbd>), </kbd><var>Object</var><kbd>).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will create an instance of <var>Class</var> and execute the <var>Body</var> of the
create method, using the specified <var>Arguments</var>. The variable
<var>Object</var> is bound to the new instance.

   <p>If a simple class definition has no create methods, it is
impossible create instances of the class. While the absence of create
methods may be a programmer error, that is not always the
case. Abstract classes, which are classes that cannot have instances,
are often quite useful in defining a class hierarchy.

   <p>Create methods can be used to initialize slots in situations when
specifying initial slot values will not suffice. (Remember that
initial values must be specified as constants at compile time).  The
simplest case uses the arguments of the create message as initial slot
values. For example, the definition of the point class might contain
the following create method.

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- create(X,Y) :-
             Self &lt;&lt; x(X),
             Self &lt;&lt; y(Y).
</pre>
   <p>If used as follows

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(point(3.14159, 2.71828), PointObj),
          PointObj &gt;&gt; x(X),
          PointObj &gt;&gt; y(Y).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">it would give <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> the values of 3.14159 and 2.71828, respectively.

   <p>In some cases, the create method might compute the initial values. The
following (partial) class definition uses the <code>date/1</code> predicate from
<code>library(date)</code> to initialize its year, month and day slots.

<pre class="example">     :- class date_stamp =
             [year:integer,
              month:integer,
              day:integer].
     
     Self &lt;- create :-
             date(date(Year, Month, Day)),
             store_slot(year, Year),
             store_slot(month, Month),
             store_slot(day, Day).
</pre>
   <p>All three slots are private, so it will be necessary to define get
methods in order to retrieve the time information. If no put methods
are defined, however, the date cannot be modified after
the <code>date_stamp</code> object is created (unless some other method for
this class invokes <code>store_slot/2</code> itself).

   <p>Create methods can do more than initialize slot values. Consider the
<code>named_point</code> class, whose definition begins as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class named_point =
             [public name:atom,
              public x:float=1,
              public y:float=0].
     
     Self &lt;- create(Name, X, Y) :-
             Self &lt;&lt; name(Name),
             Self &lt;&lt; x(X),
             Self &lt;&lt; y(Y),
             assert(name_point(Name, Self)).
</pre>
   <p>Not only does the <code>create/3</code> message initialize the slots of a new
<code>named_point</code> object, but it also adds a <code>name_point/2</code> fact to
the Prolog database, allowing each new object to be found by its
name. (This create method does not require the <code>named_point</code> object
to have a unique name. Defining a <code>uniq_named_point</code> class is left
as an exercise.)

   <p>An object is destroyed with the <code>destroy/1</code> command. Unlike
<code>create/2</code>, <code>destroy/1</code> does not require that you define a <code>destroy</code>
method for a class. However, <code>destroy/1</code> will send a destroy message
(with no arguments) to an object before it is destroyed, if a
<code>destroy</code> method is
defined for the object's class.

   <p>If a <code>named_point</code> object is ever destroyed, the address of the
object stored in this name <code>point/2</code> fact is no longer valid. Hence,
there should be a corresponding destroy method that retracts it.

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- destroy :-
             Self &gt;&gt; name(Name),
             retract(name_point(Name, Self)).
</pre>
   <p>Similar create and destroy methods can be defined for objects that
allocate their own separate memory or that announce their existence to
foreign code.

<h4 class="subheading">Instance Methods</h4>

<p>Instance methods allow each object in a class to have its own method
for handling a specified message. For example, in a push-button class
it would be convenient for each instance (each push-button) to have
its own method for responding to being pressed.

   <p>The declaration

<pre class="example">     :- instance_method <var>Name/Arity</var>, <var><small class="dots">...</small></var>.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">inside a class definition states that the message <var>Name/Arity</var>
supports instance methods. If the class definition defines a method
for this message, it will be treated as a default method for the
message.

   <p>The <code>define_method/3</code> predicate installs a method for an object of
the class, and the <code>undefine_method/3</code> predicate removes that
method.

   <p>Suppose that the <code>date_stamp</code> class, defined earlier, declared an
instance method to print the year of a <code>date_stamp</code> instance.

<pre class="example">     :- instance_method print_year/1.
     
     Self &lt;- print_year(Stream) :-
             Self &gt;&gt; year(Y0),
             Y1 is YO + 1970,
             format(Stream, "~d", [Y1]).
</pre>
   <p>The arithmetic is necessary because UNIX dates are based on January 1, 1970.

   <p>If a particular <code>date_stamp</code> object's date were to be printed in
Roman numerals, it could be given a different <code>print_year</code> method, using
the <code>define_method/3</code> predicate.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(date_stamp, DateObj),
          define_method(DateObj,
     		   print_year(Stream),
     		   print_roman_year(Stream, DateObj)).</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>If this <code>date_stamp</code> object is created in 1994, a
<code>print_year</code> message sent to it would print the current year as

<pre class="example">     MCMXCIV
</pre>
   <p>Defining the predicate <code>print_roman_year/2</code> is left as an exercise. It
must be able to access the <code>year</code> slot of a <code>date_stamp</code> object. Because
it is not defined by a method clause within the class definition,
<code>print_roman_year/2</code> cannot use the <code>get_slot/2</code> predicate.

   <p>None of <code>instance_method/1</code>, <code>define_method/3</code>,
<code>undefine_method/3</code> specify a message operator. Instance methods can
only be defined for send messages.
