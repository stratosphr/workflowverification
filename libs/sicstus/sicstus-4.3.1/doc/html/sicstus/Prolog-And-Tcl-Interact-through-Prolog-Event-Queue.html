<h5 class="subsubsection">10.37.5.3 Prolog And Tcl Interact through Prolog Event Queue</h5>

<p>In the previous two methods, one of the language systems was the master
and the other slave, the master called the slave to perform some action
or calculation, the slave sits waiting until the master calls it.  We
have seen that this has disadvantages when Prolog is the slave in that
the state of the Prolog call is lost. Each Prolog call starts from the
beginning unless we save the state using message database
manipulation through calls to <code>assert</code> and <code>retract</code>.

   <p>Using the Prolog event queue, however, it is possible to get a more
balanced model where the two language systems cooperate without
either really being the master or the slave.

   <p>One way to do this is the following:

     <ul>
<li>Prolog is started
<li>load Tcl/Tk library
<li>load and set up the Tcl side of the program
<li>Prolog starts a processing loop
<li>it periodically checks for a Prolog event and processes it
<li>Prolog updates the Tcl display through <code>tcl_eval</code> calls
</ul>

   <p>What can processing a Prolog event mean? Well, for example, a button
press from Tk could tell the Prolog program to finish or to start
processing something else.  The Tcl program is not making an
explicit call to the Prolog system but sending a message to Prolog. The
Prolog system can pick up the message and process it when it chooses, in
the meantime keeping its run state and variables intact.

   <p>To illustrate this, we return to the 8-queens example.  If Tcl/Tk is the
master and Prolog the slave, we have shown that using a callback to
Prolog, we can imagine that we hit a button, call Prolog to get a
solution and then display it. But how do we get the next solution? 
We could get all the solutions, and then use Tcl/Tk code to step
through them, but that doesn't seem satisfactory. 
If we use the Prolog is the master and Tcl/Tk is the slave model,
we have shown how we can use Tcl/Tk to display the solutions
generate from the Prolog side: Prolog just make a call to the Tcl side
when it has a solution. But in this model Tcl/Tk widgets don't
interact with the Prolog side; Tcl/Tk is mearly an add-on display
to Prolog.

   <p>But using the Prolog event queue we can get the best of both worlds:
Prolog can generate each solution in turn as Tcl/Tk asks for it.

   <p>Here is the code on the Prolog side that does this.  (We have left out
parts of the code that haven't changed from our previous example,
see <a href="Queens-Display.html#Queens-Display">Queens Display</a>).

<pre class="example">     :- use_module(library(tcltk)).
     :- use_module(library(lists)).
     
     setup :-
         tk_new([name('SICStus+Tcl/Tk - Queens')], Tcl),
         tcl_eval(Tcl, 'source queens2.tcl', _),
         tk_next_event(Tcl, Event),
         (   Event = next -&gt; go(Tcl)
         ;   closedown(Tcl)
         ).
     
     closedown(Tcl) :-
         tcl_delete(Tcl).
     
     go(Tcl) :-
         tcl_eval(Tcl, 'clear_board', _),
         queens(8, Qs),
         show_solution(Qs),
         tk_next_event(Tcl, Event),
         (   Event = next -&gt; fail
         ;   closedown(Tcl)
         ).
     go(Tcl) :-
         tcl_eval(Tcl, 'disable_next', _),
         tcl_eval(Tcl, 'clear_board', _),
         tk_next_event(Tcl, _Event),
         closedown(Tcl).
     
     show_solution(Tcl, L) :-
         tcl(Tcl),
         reverse(L, LR),
         tcl_eval(Tcl, [show_solution, br(LR)], _),
         tk_do_all_events.
</pre>
   <p>Notice here that we have used <code>tk_next_event/2</code> in several places. 
The code is executed by calling <code>setup/0</code>.  As usual, this loads in
the Tcl part of the program, but then Prolog waits for a message
from the Tcl side.  This message can either be <code>next</code>, indicating
that we want to show the next solution, or <code>stop</code>, indicating that
we want to stop the program.

   <p>If <code>next</code> is received, the program goes on to execute
<code>go/1</code>.  What this does it to first calculate a solution to the
8-queens problem, displays the solution through <code>show_solution/2</code>,
and then waits for another message from Tcl/Tk.  Again this can be
either <code>next</code> or <code>stop</code>. If <code>next</code>, the program
goes into the failure part of a failure driven loop and generates and
displays the next solution.

   <p>If at any time <code>stop</code> is received, the program terminates
gracefully, cleaning up the Tcl interpreter.

   <p>On the Tcl/Tk side all we need are a couple of buttons:
one for sending the <code>next</code> message, and the other for sending the
<code>stop</code> message.

<pre class="example">     button .next -text next -command {prolog_event next}
     pack .next
     
     button .stop -text stop -command {prolog_event stop}
     pack .stop
</pre>
   <p>(We could get more sophisticated. We might want it so that when the
button it is depressed until Prolog has finished processing the last
message, when the button is allowed to pop back up. This would avoid the
problem of the user pressing the button many times while the
program is still processing the last request. We leave this as an
exercise for the reader.)
