<h5 class="subsubsection">10.8.2.2 Semantics</h5>

<p>In this subsubsection the operational semantics of CHR in Prolog are presented
informally. They don't differ essentially from other CHR systems.

   <p>When a constraint is called, it is considered an active constraint and
the system will try to apply the rules to it. Rules are tried and executed
sequentially in the order they are written.

   <p>A rule is conceptually tried for an active constraint in the following
way. The active constraint is matched with a constraint in the head of
the rule. If more constraints appear in the head they are looked for
among the suspended constraints, which are called passive constraints in
this context. If the necessary passive constraints can be found and all
match with the head of the rule and the guard of the rule succeeds,
the rule is committed and the body of the rule executed. If not all the
necessary passive constraint can be found, the matching fails or the
guard fails, the body is not executed and the process of trying and
executing simply continues with the following rules. If for a rule,
there are multiple constraints in the head, the active constraint will
try the rule sequentially multiple times, each time trying to match with
another constraint.

   <p>This process ends either when the active constraint disappears, i.e. it
is removed by some rule, or after the last rule has been processed. In
the latter case the active constraint becomes suspended.

   <p>A suspended constraint is eligible as a passive constraint for an active
constraint. The other way it may interact again with the rules, is when
a variable appearing in the constraint becomes bound to either a non-variable
or another variable involved in one or more constraints. In that case the
constraint is triggered, i.e. it becomes an active constraint and all
the rules are tried.

   <p><b>Rule Types.</b>
There are three different kinds of rules, each with their specific semantics:

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>simplification</dfn><dd>The simplification rule removes the constraints in its head and calls its body.

     <br><dt><dfn>propagation</dfn><dd>The propagation rule calls its body exactly once for the constraints in
its head.

     <br><dt><dfn>simpagation</dfn><dd>The simpagation rule removes the constraints in its head after the
<code>\</code> and then calls its body. It is an optimization of
simplification rules of the form:

     <pre class="example">          <var>constraints_1</var>, <var>constraints_2</var> &lt;=&gt; <var>constraints_1</var>, <var>body</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">namely, in the simpagation form:

     <pre class="example">          <var>constraints_1</var> \ <var>constraints_2</var> &lt;=&gt; <var>body</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the <var>constraints_1</var> constraints are not called in the body. 
</dl>

   <p><b>Rule Names.</b>
Naming a rule is optional and has no semantical meaning. It only functions
as documentation for the programmer.

   <p><b>Pragmas.</b>
The semantics of the pragmas are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>passive(</code><var>Identifier</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-passive_002f1-_0028CHR-pragma_0029-2713"></a>The constraint in the head of a rule <var>Identifier</var> can only match a
passive constraint in that rule. 
</dl>

   <p>Additional pragmas may be released in the future.

   <p><b>Options.</b>
<a name="index-chr_005foption_002f2-_0028CHR-declaration_0029-2714"></a><a name="index-chr_005foption_002f2-_0028CHR-declaration_0029-2715"></a>
It is possible to specify options that apply to all the CHR rules in the module. 
Options are specified with the <code>chr_option/2</code> declaration:

<pre class="example">     :- chr_option(Option,Value).
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and may appear in the file anywhere after the first constraints declaration.

   <p>Available options are:
     <dl>
<dt><code>check_guard_bindings</code><dd><a name="index-check_005fguard_005fbindings-_0028CHR-option_0029-2716"></a>This option controls whether guards should be checked for (illegal) variable
bindings or not. Possible values for this option are <code>on</code>, to enable
the checks, and <code>off</code>, to disable the checks. If this option is on,
any guard fails when it binds a variable that appears in the head of the rule. 
When the option is off, the behavior of a binding in the guard is undefined.

     <br><dt><code>optimize</code><dd><a name="index-optimize-_0028CHR-option_0029-2717"></a>This option controls the degree of optimization. 
Possible values are <code>full</code>, to enable all available
optimizations, and <code>off</code> (the default), to disable all optimizations. 
If optimization is enabled, debugging must be disabled.

     <br><dt><code>debug</code><dd><a name="index-debug-_0028CHR-option_0029-2718"></a>This options enables or disables the possibility to debug the CHR code. 
Possible values are <code>on</code> (the default) and <code>off</code>. See
<a href="CHR-Debugging.html#CHR-Debugging">CHR Debugging</a> for more details on debugging.
