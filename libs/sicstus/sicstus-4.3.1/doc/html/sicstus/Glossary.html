<dt><dfn>abolish</dfn><dd><a name="index-abolish-_0028definition_0029-22"></a>To abolish a predicate is to retract all the
predicate's clauses and to remove all information about it
from the Prolog system, to make it as if that predicate had never
existed.

     <br><dt><dfn>advice-point</dfn><dd><a name="index-advice_002dpoint-_0028definition_0029-23"></a>A special case of breakpoint, the advice breakpoint. It is
distinguished from spypoints in that it is intended for
non-interactive debugging, such as checking of program invariants,
collecting information, profiling, etc.

     <!-- @item aligned pointer -->
     <!-- @cindex aligned pointer (definition) -->
     <!-- @cindex pointer, aligned (definition) -->
     <!-- An aligned pointer is @code{NULL} or an address having the four most -->
     <!-- significant bits consistent with the smallest non-NULL representation returned -->
     <!-- by the function @code{SP_malloc()}. In particular, under Linux, these -->
     <!-- bits must be zero.  Furthermore, the address must be aligned on a four -->
     <!-- bytes boundary.  Aligned pointers are represented by integers in Prolog. -->
     <!-- In particular, @code{NULL} is represented by 0. -->
     <!-- Aligned pointers are relevant in the foreign language interface, -->
     <!-- in @code{stream_code/2}, and in the memory manager's bottom layer. -->

representation is therefore inaccessible.  An anonymous variable is denoted
by an underscore (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <br><dt><dfn>argument</dfn><dd><a name="index-argument-_0028definition_0029-28"></a>See predicate, structure, and arity.

     <br><dt><dfn>arity</dfn><dd><a name="index-arity-_0028definition_0029-29"></a>The arity of a structure is its number of arguments. 
For example, the structure <code>customer(jones,85)</code> has an arity
of 2.

     <br><dt><dfn>atom</dfn><dd><a name="index-atom-_0028definition_0029-30"></a><a name="index-SP_005fatom-_0028C-type_0029-31"></a>A character sequence used to uniquely denote some entity in the problem
domain.  A number is <em>not</em> an atom.  Examples of legal atoms are:

</pre>
     <p>See <a href="ref_002dsyn_002dtrm_002dato.html#ref_002dsyn_002dtrm_002dato">ref-syn-trm-ato</a>.  Atoms are recognized by the built-in
predicate <code>atom/1</code>.  Each Prolog atom is represented
internally by a unique integer, represented in C as an <code>SP_atom</code>.

clause following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:-</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol.

     <br><dt><dfn>breakpoint</dfn><dd><a name="index-breakpoint-_0028definition_0029-40"></a>A description of certain invocations in the program where the user
wants the debugger to stop, or to perform some other actions.  A
breakpoint is specific if it applies to the calls of a
specific predicate, possibly under some conditions; otherwise, it
is generic. Depending on the intended usage, breakpoints can
be classified as debugger breakpoints, also known as
spypoints, or advice breakpoints, also called
advice-points; see <a href="Advanced-Debugging.html#Advanced-Debugging">Advanced Debugging</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>breakpoint spec</dfn><dd><a name="index-breakpoint-spec-_0028definition_0029-41"></a>A term describing a breakpoint. Composed of a test

superset of Unicode, which includes the ASCII code set, i.e. codes
0..127, and these codes are interpreted as ASCII characters
<!-- ISO TODO -->
<!-- The processor character set PCS is an implementation -->

     <br><dt><dfn>character-conversion mapping</dfn><dd><a name="index-character_002dconversion-mapping-_0028definition_0029-51"></a>SICStus Prolog maintains a character-conversion mapping, which is
used while reading terms and programs. Initially, the
mapping prescribes no character conversions. It can be modified by the
built-in predicate <code>char_conversion(</code><var>In</var><code>, </code><var>Out</var><code>)</code>,
following which <var>In</var> will be converted to <var>Out</var>. Character
coversion can be switched off by the <code>char_conversion</code> Prolog flag.

     <p><strong>Please note</strong>: the mapping is <em>global</em>, as opposed to being
local to the current module, Prolog text, or otherwise. 
<a name="index-char_005fconversion-_0028prolog-flag_0029-52"></a>
<br><dt><dfn>character-type mapping</dfn><dd><a name="index-character_002dtype-mapping-_0028definition_0029-53"></a>A function mapping each element of the character code set to one
of the character categories (whitespace, letter, symbol-char, etc.),
required for parsing tokens.

disjunctions.

     <br><dt><dfn>clause</dfn><dd><a name="index-clause-_0028definition_0029-55"></a>A fact or a rule.  A rule comprises a <dfn>head</dfn> and a

equivalent to a rule with the body <code>true</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>code-list</dfn><dd><a name="index-code_002dlist-_0028definition_0029-56"></a>A code-list is a list of character codes.

     <br><dt><dfn>conditional compilation</dfn><dd><a name="index-conditional-compilation-_0028definition_0029-57"></a>Conditionally including or excluding parts of a file at compile time.

<br><dt><dfn>compile</dfn><dd><a name="index-compile-_0028definition_0029-60"></a>To load a program (or a portion thereof) into Prolog through
the compiler.  Compiled code runs more quickly than
interpreted code, and provides better precision for execution profiling
and coverage analysis.  On the other hand, you cannot debug compiled code in as
much detail as interpreted code.

     <br><dt><dfn>compound term</dfn><dd><a name="index-compound-term-_0028definition_0029-61"></a><a name="index-term_002c-compound-_0028definition_0029-62"></a>A compound term is a term that is an atom together
with one or more arguments.  For example, in the term
<code>father(X)</code>, <code>father</code> is the name, and <code>X</code> is the first
and only argument.  The argument to a compound term
can be another compound term, as in <code>father(father(X))</code>. 
Compound terms are recognized by the built-in predicate
<code>compound/1</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>conjunction</dfn><dd><a name="index-conjunction-_0028definition_0029-63"></a>A series of goals connected by the connective &ldquo;and&rdquo; (that is, a

example: 12.35), or an atom.  Constants are recognized by
the built-in predicate <code>atomic/1</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>consult</dfn><dd><a name="index-consult-_0028definition_0029-67"></a>To load a program (or a portion thereof) into Prolog through the
interpreter.  Interpreted code runs more slowly than compiled code, and
does not provide as good precision for execution profiling and coverage
analysis.  On the other hand, you can debug interpreted code in more
detail than compiled code.

     <br><dt><dfn>control structure</dfn><dd><a name="index-control-structure-_0028definition_0029-68"></a><a name="index-structure_002c-control-_0028definition_0029-69"></a>A built-in predicate that is &ldquo;part of the language&rdquo; in the sense
that it is treated specially in certain language features.  The set of
such control structures and language features is enuemrated in
<a href="ref_002dsem_002dctr.html#ref_002dsem_002dctr">ref-sem-ctr</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>cut</dfn><dd><a name="index-cut-_0028definition_0029-72"></a>Written as <code>!</code>.  A built-in predicate that succeeds when
encountered; if backtracking should later return to the cut,
the goal that matched the head of the clause
containing the cut fails immediately.

     <br><dt><dfn>database</dfn><dd><a name="index-database-_0028definition_0029-73"></a>The Prolog database comprises all of the clauses that have
been loaded or asserted into the Prolog system or that have been
asserted, except those clauses that have been retracted or
abolished.

     <br><dt><dfn>db_reference</dfn><dd><a name="index-db_005freference-_0028definition_0029-74"></a>A compound term denoting a unique reference to a dynamic clause.

for the <code>compiling</code> Prolog flag.

     <br><dt><dfn>declaration</dfn><dd><a name="index-declaration-_0028definition_0029-77"></a>A declaration looks like a directive, but is not executed
but rather conveys information about predicates about to be loaded.

     <br><dt><dfn>deinit function</dfn><dd><a name="index-deinit-function-_0028definition_0029-78"></a><a name="index-function_002c-deinit-_0028definition_0029-79"></a>A function in a foreign resource that is called prior to unloading

A <dfn>partial list</dfn> is either a variable, or a compound term whose
principal functor is the <dfn>list constructor</dfn> (<code>'.'/2</code>) and whose
second argument is a partial list. Often it is implied that the partial
list is not a variable.

     <p>A <dfn>proper list</dfn> is either the <dfn>empty list</dfn>, i.e. the atom
<code>[]</code>, or a compound term whose principal functor is the list
constructor (<code>'.'/2</code>) and whose second argument is a proper list.

     <p>A partial list or a proper list that is a compound term is said to be
<dfn>non-empty</dfn>.

     <p>In many cases <dfn>list</dfn> is used to denote both the case of a proper
list and the case of a, most often non-variable, partial list.

     <p>A <dfn>cyclic list</dfn> is a compound term whose principal functor is the
list constructor (<code>'.'/2</code>) and whose second argument is a cyclic
list, e.g. what could be constructed using <code>L='.'(a,L)</code>, or
<code>L=[a,b|L]</code>. Passing a cyclic list as an argument to a predicate
that expects a partial or proper list should be avoided as not all
predictes are prepared to handle such input.

     <p>A list is often written using <dfn>list syntax</dfn>, e.g. using
<code>[a,b]</code> to denote the (proper) list <code>'.'(a,'.'(b,[]))</code>, or
using <code>[a,b|Tail]</code> to denote the (partial) list
<code>'.'(a,'.'(b,Tail))</code>.

referred to in I/O predicates.  Must be an atom.  There are
also three predefined aliases for the standard streams:
<code>user_input</code>, <code>user_output</code> and <code>user_error</code>. 
Although not a stream alias proper, the atom <code>user</code>
also stands for the standard input
or output stream, depending on context.

     <br><dt><dfn>stream object</dfn><dd><a name="index-stream-object-_0028definition_0029-228"></a>A term denoting an open Prolog stream.  See <a href="ref_002diou.html#ref_002diou">ref-iou</a>.

position is determined by the current byte, character and line counts
and line position.  Standard term comparison on stream
position terms works as expected.  When <code>SP1</code> and <code>SP2</code>
refer to positions in the same stream, <code>SP1@&lt;SP2</code> if and
only if <code>SP1</code> is before <code>SP2</code> in the stream.  You should
not otherwise rely on their internal representation.

</pre>
     <!-- In @code{iso} execution mode, -->
     <p>By setting the Prolog flag <code>double_quotes</code>, the meaning of
strings can be changed. With an appropriate setting, a
string can be made to denote a char-list, or an atom. 
Strings are <em>not</em> a separate data type.

     <br><dt><dfn>system property</dfn><dd><a name="index-system-property-_0028definition_0029-238"></a>SICStus Prolog stores some information in named variables called system
properties. System properties are used as of release 4.1, where
previous releases used environment variables.

     <p>The default representation for a system property is taken from the corresponding
environment variable. Any exceptions to this rule is explicitly
mentioned in the documentation. See <a href="System-Properties-and-Environment-Variables.html#System-Properties-and-Environment-Variables">System Properties and Environment Variables</a> for more information.

     <br><dt><dfn>term</dfn><dd><a name="index-term-_0028definition_0029-239"></a>A basic data object in Prolog.  A term can be a constant, a

clause during the evaluation of a query, or of matching
arbitrary terms with one another during program execution.

     <p>The rules governing the unification of terms are:

          <ul>
<li>Two constants unify with one another if they are identical.

          <li>A variable unifies with a constant or a compound
term.  As a result of the unification, the variable is
instantiated to the constant or compound term.

          <li>A variable unifies with another variable.  As a result
of the unification, they become the same variable.

          <li>A compound term unifies with another compound term if
they have the same functor and if all of the arguments can
be unified.

     <br><dt><dfn>variable</dfn><dd><a name="index-variable-_0028definition_0029-249"></a>A logical variable is a name that stands for objects that may or
may not be determined at a specific point in a Prolog program. 
When the object for which the variable stands is determined in the
Prolog program, the variable becomes instantiated.  A
logical variable may be unified with a constant, a
compound term, or another variable.  Variables become
uninstantiated when the predicate they occur in
backtracks past the point at which they were instantiated.

     <p>Variables may be written as any sequence of alphanumeric
characters starting with either a capital letter or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;; e.g.:

     <pre class="example">          X   Y   Z   Name   Position   _c   _305  One_stop

     <br><dt><dfn>volatile</dfn><dd><a name="index-volatile-_0028definition_0029-250"></a>Predicate property.  The clauses of a volatile
predicate are not saved in saved-states.

standard streams to that window.

     <br><dt><dfn>zip</dfn><dd><a name="index-zip-_0028definition_0029-253"></a>Same as debug mode, except no debugging information is collected
