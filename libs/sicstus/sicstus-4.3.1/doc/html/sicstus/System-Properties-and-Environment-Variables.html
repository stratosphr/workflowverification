<h4 class="subsection">4.17.1 System Properties and Environment Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-system-properties-1832"></a><a name="index-environment-variables-1833"></a>
SICStus Prolog stores some information in named variables called
system properties. System properties are used since release 4.1,
whereas previous releases used environment variables.

   <p>The default representation when reading a system property is taken from the
corresponding environment variable. This makes system properties largely
backward compatible with how environment variables were used in previous
releases. Any exceptions to this rule are explicitly mentioned in the
documentation.

   <p>You can obtain the representation of system properties and environment variables
using <code>system:environ/[2,3]</code> (see <a href="lib_002dsystem.html#lib_002dsystem">lib-system</a>) and
<code>SP_getenv()</code>.

   <p>Some system properties affect the SICStus Prolog initialization process
and must therefore be set before SICStus Prolog has been
initialized. There are three ways to affect the initial values of system
properties:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Set the corresponding environment variable.

     <p>System properties get their default representation from the environment
so this is often a convenient method. It was the only method available
prior to release 4.1.

     <li>Pass the <samp><span class="option">-D</span><var>var</var><span class="option">=</span><var>representation</var></samp> option to the <samp><span class="command">sicstus</span></samp>
command line tool. See <a href="too_002dsicstus.html#too_002dsicstus">too-sicstus</a>.

     <li>Pass an option block to <code>SP_initialize()</code> if you initialize
the SICStus runtime from C. See <a href="Initializing-the-Prolog-Engine.html#Initializing-the-Prolog-Engine">Initializing the Prolog Engine</a>.

        </ol>

   <p>Looking up system properties follows the platform convention for
environment variables. This means that the lookup is case sensitive on
UNIX-like platforms and case insensitive on Windows.

   <p>On UNIX-like systems, the environment is assumed to use the UTF-8
character encoding; on Windows, the native Unicode encoding is used.

   <p>SICStus reads and copies the process environment during
initialization, e.g. in <code>SP_initialize()</code>. Any subsequent
changes to the proces environment will not be detected by
SICStus. Note that, at least on UNIX-like systems, changing the
process environment, e.g. using <code>setenv()</code>, has undefined behavior
when the process has multiple threads, which is the case for any
process running SICStus.

   <p>While copying the environment, each entry in the environment is
normalized as follows:
     <ul>
<li>If it does not contain an equal sign, the entry is ignored. 
<li>On Windows only, if it starts with an equal sign but has no other
equal signs, the entry is ignored. 
<li>If the entry consists of valid UTF-8, it is kept as is. This is
always true on Windows where a Unicode encoding is used internally by
the operating system. 
<li>If the entry does not consist of valid UTF-8, it is treated as
Latin-1 and converted to UTF-8. This cannot happen on Windows. 
<li>On Windows only, if the entry starts with an equal sign, the equal
sign is treated as part of the variable name. 
</ul>

   <p>In particular, on UNIX-like systems, this means that the environment
should preferably be in UTF-8.

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.17.1.1 System Properties Set by SICStus Prolog</h5>

<p>The following system properties are set automatically on startup.

the application was linked statically to the SICStus runtime, <samp><span class="env">SP_RT_DIR</span></samp>
is the same as <samp><span class="env">SP_APP_DIR</span></samp>. 
Also available as the <code>runtime</code> file search path.

     <p><a name="index-SP_005fRT_005fPATH-_0028system-property_0029-1837"></a><br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_RT_PATH</span></samp><dd>The absolute path to the SICStus runtime. Unlike <samp><span class="env">SP_RT_DIR</span></samp>, this
system property may not be available under all circumstances, e.g. if
the runtime is not a shared library.

     <p><a name="index-SP_005fLIBRARY_005fDIR-_0028system-property_0029-1838"></a><br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_LIBRARY_DIR</span></samp><dd>The absolute path to the directory that contains the SICStus library files. 
Also available as the initial representation of the <code>library</code> file search path.

     <p>Note that this system property can also be set prior to initialization,
in order to tell SICStus which working directory to use. See below.

   </dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.17.1.2 System Properties Affecting Initialization</h5>

<p>The following system properties can be set before starting SICStus
Prolog.

   <p>Some of these override the default sizes of certain areas. 
For variables ending with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SIZE</span></samp>&rsquo;, the size is in bytes, but may
be followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">K</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">G</span></samp>&rsquo; meaning 2**10, 2**20
and 2**30 respectively.

   <p>Boolean values true and false are represented by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">yes</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.

   <p>See <a href="ref_002dmgc.html#ref_002dmgc">Memory Use and Garbage Collection</a> for more information
about the properties that affect memory management.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="env">SP_PATH</span></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fPATH-_0028system-property_0029-1840"></a>Can be used to specify the location of the Runtime Library.  In most
cases there is no need to use it, but see <a href="CPL-Notes.html#CPL-Notes">CPL Notes</a>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_STARTUP_DIR</span></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fSTARTUP_005fDIR-_0028system-property_0029-1841"></a>The representation of this system property, if set, is used as the initial
working directory. Note that this system property is also set
automatically during initialization; see above.

     <p>This representation of this system property is <em>not</em> read from the
corresponding environment variable.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_ALLOW_CHDIR</span></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fALLOW_005fCHDIR-_0028system-property_0029-1842"></a>
If this system property is set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&rsquo;, then SICStus will not
change the process's working directory when the SICStus working directory
changes. This is useful when embedding SICStus and would probably be the
better default behavior except for backwards compatibility.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">GLOBALSTKSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-GLOBALSTKSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1843"></a>Controls the initial size of the global stack. 
<strong>Please note</strong>: The global stack will not be subsequently
trimmed to a size smaller than this initial size.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">LOCALSTKSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-LOCALSTKSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1844"></a>Controls the initial size of the local stack. 
<strong>Please note</strong>: The local stack will not be subsequently
trimmed to a size smaller than this initial size.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">CHOICESTKSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-CHOICESTKSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1845"></a>Controls the initial size of the choicepoint stack. 
<strong>Please note</strong>: The choicepoint stack will not be subsequently
trimmed to a size smaller than this initial size.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">TRAILSTKSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-TRAILSTKSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1846"></a>Controls the initial size of the trail stack. 
<strong>Please note</strong>: The trail stack will not be subsequently
trimmed to a size smaller than this initial size.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">GROWTHFACTOR &nbsp;<!-- /@w --> </span><strong>since release 4.0.8</strong></samp><dd><a name="index-GROWTHFACTOR-_0028system-property_0029-1847"></a>Meaningful values are between 10 and 100; the default is 62. 
Controls the rate at which the Prolog stacks grow when they are
expanded.  These stacks are stored in two data areas: one holding
the global and local stacks; another one holding the choicepoint and
trail stacks.  In addition, both data areas hold some memory
reserved for the garbage collector.

     <p>The sizes of the two data areas are constrained to take certain
discrete values only.  The initial size as well as the size after
expansion is constrained to be <var>w*((1+g)^n)</var> kilobytes, rounded up
to an integral number of words, where <var>w</var> is the word length in
bits, <var>g</var> is <samp><span class="env">GROWTHFACTOR</span></samp>/100, and <var>n</var> is an integer.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">PROLOGINITSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-PROLOGINITSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1848"></a>Controls the size of Prolog's initial memory allocation. 
Only used by the default memory allocator
(see <a href="cpg_002dref_002dSP_005fset_005fmemalloc_005fhooks.html#cpg_002dref_002dSP_005fset_005fmemalloc_005fhooks">SP_set_memalloc_hooks</a>). 
<strong>Please note</strong>: This initially allocated memory will be kept by
the Prolog process until <code>SP_deinitialize()</code> is called or the
process exits.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">PROLOGMAXSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-PROLOGMAXSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1849"></a>Defines an upper bound on the amount of memory that Prolog will use. 
If not set, Prolog will try to use the available address space. 
Only used by the default memory allocator
(see <a href="cpg_002dref_002dSP_005fset_005fmemalloc_005fhooks.html#cpg_002dref_002dSP_005fset_005fmemalloc_005fhooks">SP_set_memalloc_hooks</a>). 
Thus if Prolog needs to allocate memory beyond this bound, a memory
resource error will be raised.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">PROLOGINCSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-PROLOGINCSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1850"></a>Controls the amount of memory Prolog asks the operating system for in any
given memory expansion.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">PROLOGKEEPSIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-PROLOGKEEPSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1851"></a>Defines a lower bound on the amount of memory retained by
<code>trimcore/0</code>.  By default, Prolog gets memory from the O/S as the
user program executes, whereas <code>trimcore/0</code> endeavors to return
free memory back to the O/S.  If the programmer knows that her
program, once it has grown to a certain size, is likely to need as
much memory for future computations, she can advise Prolog not to
return all the free memory back to the operating system by setting
this variable.  <code>trimcore/0</code> only endeavors to return memory that is
allocated above and beyond <samp><span class="env">PROLOGKEEPSIZE</span></samp>; the rest will be
kept.  Only used by the default memory allocator
(see <a href="cpg_002dref_002dSP_005fset_005fmemalloc_005fhooks.html#cpg_002dref_002dSP_005fset_005fmemalloc_005fhooks">SP_set_memalloc_hooks</a>). 
<strong>Please note</strong>: The initially allocated memory will be kept by
the Prolog process forever, so it is not meaningful to set
<samp><span class="env">PROLOGKEEPSIZE</span></samp> smaller than <samp><span class="env">PROLOGINITSIZE</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_ULIMIT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE</span></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fULIMIT_005fDATA_005fSEGMENT_005fSIZE-_0028system-property_0029-1852"></a>Sets the maximum size of the data segment of the Prolog process. The
representation can be <code>unlimited</code> or a numeric representation as described in the
first paragraph in this section. A numeric representation of zero (0) is
equivalent to <code>unlimited</code>. Not used under Windows.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_USE_MALLOC</span></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fUSE_005fMALLOC-_0028system-property_0029-1853"></a>If <code>yes</code> then <code>malloc()</code> et al. will be used for memory
management instead of the default memory allocator. This is sometimes
useful, e.g$: with debugging tools like
<samp><span class="command">valgrind</span></samp>. 
<!-- [PM] 4.3 -m and -userhook=malloc was never in SP4. -->
<!-- Corresponds to the @option{-m} flag to -->
<!-- @command{sicstus} and the @option{-userhook=malloc} flag to -->
<!-- @command{spld} (@pxref{cpg-ref-SP_set_memalloc_hooks, , -->
<!-- SP_set_memalloc_hooks}). -->

     <p><strong>Please note</strong>: Enabling <code>malloc()</code> allocation is not
compatible with JIT compilation.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_JIT &nbsp;<!-- /@w --> </span><strong>since release 4.3</strong></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fJIT-_0028system-property_0029-1854"></a>

platforms that support JIT compilation. 
<br><dt><code>no</code><dd>JIT compilation is enabled but does not happen automatically. Currently, there
is no documented way to JIT compile predicates manually. 
<br><dt><code>disabled</code><dd>JIT compilation is disabled completely. Please report if you encounter any

          <p>JIT compilation may need to be disabled on certain security-hardened
operating systems, e.g. because they do not permit memory to be both
writeable and executable. 
</dl>

     <p>This system property is ignored on platforms that do not support the
JIT compiler.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_JIT_COUNTER_LIMIT &nbsp;<!-- /@w --> </span><strong>since release 4.3</strong></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fJIT_005fCOUNTER_005fLIMIT-_0028system-property_0029-1857"></a>
Determines how many times a predicate can be called before it is JIT
compiled. The default is 0.

     <p>The heuristics used in order to decide when, and whether, a predicate
should be JIT compiled, is subject to change without notice. In
particular, this system property may be treated differently in some
future release.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="env">SP_JIT_CLAUSE_LIMIT &nbsp;<!-- /@w --> </span><strong>since release 4.3</strong></samp><dd><a name="index-SP_005fJIT_005fCLAUSE_005fLIMIT-_0028system-property_0029-1858"></a>
Sets an upper bound on the number of clauses of a predicate for JIT
compilation to be attempted.  The default is 1024.

Specify a plugin that will be told when predicates are JIT
compiled. The details of writing or using such plugins are currently
not documented, and subject to change without notice.

     <p>There are two predefined plugins,
          <dl>
<dt><code>verbose</code><dd>Write verbose information when a predicate is JIT compiled. This can
be useful when troubleshooting problems with JIT compilation, e.g. 
if some predicate takes too long to JIT-compile.

          <p>This plugin can be activated by passing
<samp><span class="option">-DSP_SPTI_PATH=verbose</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">sicstus</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>oprofile</code><dd>
Tell OProfile profiler about the location and name of the JIT compiled
predicates. This makes it possible to use OProfile for getting
accurate and low-overhead profiling info about JIT compiled
code. Information about using OProfile for profiling jitted code is
available at the OProfile site,
<a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/">http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/</a>.

          <p>This plugin can be activated either by passing
<samp><span class="option">-DSP_SPTI_PATH=oprofile</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">sicstus</span></samp>, or, once
SICStus has started, with the goal
<code>use_module(library(oprofile))</code>.

          <p>OProfile integration is only available on Linux.

     </dl>

   </dl>

<h5 class="subsubsection">4.17.1.3 Other System Properties</h5>

<p>In addition some system properties are read during normal execution. In
this case the system property is typically not meant to be explicitly
set, instead the representation is intended to be taken from the corresponding
environment variable. Examples of such system properties include
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> and <code>HOME</code>.
