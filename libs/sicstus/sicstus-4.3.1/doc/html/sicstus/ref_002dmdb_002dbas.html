   <p>The family of assertion and retraction predicates described below
enables you to modify a Prolog program by adding or deleting clauses
while it is running.  These predicates should not be overused.   Often
people who are experienced with other programming languages have a tendency
to think in terms of global data structures, as opposed to data structures
that are passed as procedure arguments, and hence they make too much use
of assertion and retraction.  This leads to less readable and less
efficient programs.

   <p><a name="index-self_002dmodifying-procedures-1580"></a>
<a name="index-procedures_002c-self_002dmodifying-1581"></a>
An interesting question in Prolog is what happens if a procedure modifies
itself, by asserting or retracting a clause, and then fails.  On
backtracking, does the current execution of the procedure use new
clauses that are added to the bottom of the procedure?

   <blockquote>

   <p><strong>Historical note:</strong> In some non-ISO-conforming implementations
of Prolog, changes to the Prolog database become globally visible upon
the success of the built-in predicate modifying the database.  An
unsettling consequence is that the definition of a procedure can
change while it is being run.  This can lead to code that is difficult
to understand.  Furthermore, the memory performance of the interpreter
implementing these semantics is poor.  Worse yet, the semantics
rendered ineffective the added determinacy detection available through
indexing. 
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-dynamic-code_002c-semantics-of-1582"></a><a name="index-semantics-of-dynamic-code-1583"></a>
SICStus Prolog implements the &ldquo;logical&rdquo; view in updating dynamic
predicates, conforming to the ISO standard.  This means that the
definition of a dynamic procedure that is visible to a call is
effectively frozen when the call is made.  A procedure always
contains, as far as a call to it is concerned, exactly the clauses it
contained when the call was made.

   <p>A useful way to think of this is to consider that a call to a dynamic procedure
makes a <dfn>virtual copy</dfn> of the procedure and then runs the copy rather than
the original procedure.  Any changes to the procedure made by the call are
immediately reflected in the Prolog database, but not in the copy of the
procedure being run.  Thus, changes to a running procedure will not be visible
on backtracking.  A subsequent call, however, makes and runs a copy of the
modified Prolog database.  Any changes to the procedure that were made by an
earlier call will now be visible to the new call.

   <p>In addition to being more intuitive and easy to understand,
the new semantics allow interpreted code to execute
with the same determinacy detection (and excellent memory performance) as
static compiled code (see <a href="Indexing.html#Indexing">Indexing</a> for more information on determinacy
detection).
