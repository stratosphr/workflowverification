<h3 class="section">5.8 The Processing of Breakpoints</h3>

<p><a name="index-breakpoint-processing-2082"></a><a name="index-processing_002c-breakpoint-2083"></a>
This section describes in detail how the debugger handles the
breakpoints. For the purpose of this section disabled
breakpoints are not taken into account: whenever we refer to the
existence of some breakpoint(s), we always mean the existence of
<em>enabled</em> breakpoint(s).

   <p>The Prolog engine can be in one of the following three states with
respect to the debugger:

     <dl>
<dt><em>no debugging</em><dd>if there are no advice-points and the debugger is either switched
off, or doing a skip;
<br><dt><em>full debugging</em><dd>if the debugger is in trace or debug mode (creeping or leaping), or
there are any generic breakpoints;
<br><dt><em>selective debugging</em><dd>in all other cases. 
</dl>

   <p>In the <em>selective debugging</em> state only those predicate
invocations are examined, for which there exists a specific
breakpoint. In the <em>full debugging</em> state all invocations are
examined, except those calling a predicate of a hidden
module (but even these will be examined, if there is a
specific breakpoint for them). In the <em>no debugging</em> state
the debugger is not entered at predicate invocations.

   <p>Now we describe what the debugger does when examining an invocation of a
predicate, i.e. executing its Call port. The debugger
activities can be divided into three stages: advice-point
processing, spypoint processing and interaction with the user. The
last stage may be repeated several times before program execution
continues.

   <p>The first two stages are similar, as they both search for an applicable
breakpoint (spypoint or advice-point). This common
breakpoint search is carried out as follows. The debugger
considers all breakpoints of the given type, most recent
first. For each breakpoint, the test part of the spec is
evaluated, until one successful is found. Any variable
bindings created in this successful evaluation are then discarded
(this is implemented by enclosing it in double negation).  The first
breakpoint, for which the evaluation of the test part succeeds is
selected. If such a breakpoint can be found, the
breakpoint search is said to have completed successfully,
otherwise it is said to have failed.

   <p>If a breakpoint has been selected, its action part is
evaluated, normally setting some debugger action variables. If the
action part fails, as a side-effect, it is ensured that a
procedure box will be built. This is achieved by changing the
representation of the <code>command</code> action variable from <code>flit</code> to
<code>proceed</code>.

   <p>Having described the common breakpoint search, let us look at the
details of the first stage, advice-point processing. This stage is
executed only if there are any advice-points set. First, the
debugger action variables are initialized: <code>mode</code> is set to the
current debugger mode, <code>command</code> to <code>proceed</code> and <code>show</code>
to <code>silent</code>. Next, advice-point search takes place.  If this
fails, <code>command</code> is set to <code>flit</code>, otherwise its representation is
unchanged.

   <p>After completing the advice-point search the <code>command</code>
variable is examined. If its representation is divertive, i.e. different from
<code>proceed</code> and <code>flit</code>, the spypoint search stage is
omitted, and the debugger continues with the third stage. Otherwise, it
is noted that the advice-point processing has requested the building
of a procedure box (i.e. <code>command = proceed</code>), and the
debugger continues with the second stage.

   <p>The second stage is spypoint processing. This stage is skipped if
the debugger is switched off or doing a skip (<code>mode</code> is <code>off</code>
or <code>skip(_)</code>). First the <code>show</code> and <code>command</code>
variables are re-assigned, based on the hiddenness of the
predicate being invoked, the debugger mode, and the leashing
status of the port. If the predicate is both defined in, and
called from a hidden module, their values will be
<code>silent</code> and <code>flit</code>. An example of this is when a
built-in predicate is called from a hidden module, e.g. 
from a library. Otherwise, in trace mode, their values are
<code>print</code> and <code>ask</code> for leashed ports, and
<code>print</code> and <code>proceed</code> for unleashed ports. In
debug mode, the variables are set to <code>silent</code> and
<code>proceed</code>, while in zip mode to <code>silent</code> and <code>flit</code>
(<a href="Breakpoint-Actions.html#Breakpoint-Actions">Breakpoint Actions</a> contains a tabulated listing of these
initialization values).

   <p>Having initialized the debugger action variables, the spypoint
search phase is performed.  If an empty action part has been selected in
a successful search, <code>show</code> and <code>command</code> are set to
<code>print</code> and <code>ask</code>. The failure of the search is ignored.

   <p>The third stage is the interactive part. First, the goal in
question is displayed according to the representation of <code>show</code>. Next, the
representation of <code>command</code> is checked: if it is other than <code>ask</code>,
the interactive stage ends. Otherwise, (it is <code>ask</code>), the variable
<code>show</code> is re-initialized to <code>print</code>, or to
<code>print-</code><var>Sel</var>, if its representation was of form
<var>Method</var><code>-</code><var>Sel</var>. Next, the debugger prompts the user for a
command, which is interpreted either in the standard way, or through
<code>user:debugger_command_hook/2</code>. In both cases the debugger action
variables are modified as requested, and the interactive part is
repeated.

   <p>After the debugger went through all the three stages, it decides whether
to build a procedure box. This will happen if either the
advice-point stage or the other two stages require it. The latter
is decided by checking the <code>command</code> variable: if that is
<code>flit</code> or <code>flit(</code><var>Old</var><code>,</code><var>New</var><code>)</code>, no procedure
box is required by the spypoint part.  If the advice-point
does require the building of a procedure box, the above
<code>command</code> values are replaced by <code>proceed</code> and
<code>proceed(</code><var>Old</var><code>,</code><var>New</var><code>)</code>, respectively.

   <p>At the end of the process the representation of <code>mode</code> will be the new
debugging mode, and <code>command</code> will determine what the debugger will
do; see <a href="Action-Variables.html#Action-Variables">Action Variables</a>.

   <p>A similar three-stage process is carried out when the debugger arrives
at a non-Call port of a predicate. The only difference is
that the building of a procedure box is not considered
(<code>flit</code> is equivalent to <code>proceed</code>), and the hiddenness of the
predicate is not taken into account.

   <p>While the Prolog system is executing the above three-stage process for
any of the ports, it is said to be <em>inside the
debugger</em>. This is relevant, because some of the conditions can only be
evaluated in this context.
