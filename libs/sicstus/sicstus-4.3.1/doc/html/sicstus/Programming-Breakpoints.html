<h4 class="subsection">5.6.11 Programming Breakpoints</h4>

<p>We will show two examples using the advanced features of the debugger.

   <p>The first example defines a <code>hide_exit(Pred)</code> predicate,
which will hide the Exit port for <code>Pred</code> (i.e. it will
silently proceed), provided the current goal was already
ground at the Call port, and nothing was traced inside the
given invocation. The <code>hide_exit(Pred)</code> goal creates two
spypoints for predicate <code>Pred</code>:

<pre class="example">     :- meta_predicate hide_exit(:).
     hide_exit(Pred) :-
             add_breakpoint([pred(Pred),call]-
                              true(save_groundness), _),
             add_breakpoint([pred(Pred),exit,true(hide_exit)]-hide, _).
</pre>
   <p>The first spypoint is applicable at the Call port, and it
calls <code>save_groundness</code> to check if the given invocation was
ground, and if so, it stores a term <code>hide_exit(ground)</code>
in the <code>goal_private</code> attribute of the invocation.

<pre class="example">     save_groundness :-
             execution_state([goal(_:G),goal_private(Priv)]),
             ground(G), !, memberchk(hide_exit(ground), Priv).
     save_groundness.
</pre>
   <p>The second spypoint created by <code>hide_exit/1</code> is applicable at
the Exit port and it checks whether the <code>hide_exit/0</code>
condition is true. If so, it issues a <code>hide</code> action, which is a
breakpoint macro expanding to <code>[silent,proceed]</code>.

<pre class="example">     hide_exit :-
             execution_state([inv(I),max_inv(I),goal_private(Priv)]),
             memberchk(hide_exit(Ground), Priv), Ground == ground.
</pre>
   <p>Here, <code>hide_exit</code> encapsulates the tests that the invocation number
be the same as the last invocation number used (<code>max_inv</code>), and
that the <code>goal_private</code> attribute of the invocation be identical to
<code>ground</code>. The first test ensures that nothing was traced inside the
current invocation.

   <p>If we load the above code, as well as the small example below,
the following interaction, discussed below, can take place. Note that the
<code>hide_exit</code> predicate is called with the <code>_:_</code>
argument, resulting in generic spypoints being created.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>consult(user).</kbd>
     | <kbd>cnt(0) :- !.</kbd>
     | <kbd>cnt(N) :-</kbd>
             <kbd>N &gt; 0, N1 is N-1, cnt(N1).</kbd>
     | <kbd>^D</kbd>
     % consulted user in module user, 0 msec 424 bytes
     
     | ?- <kbd>hide_exit(_:_), trace, cnt(1).</kbd>
     % The debugger will first zip -- showing spypoints (zip)
     % Generic spypoint added, BID=1
     % Generic spypoint added, BID=2
     % The debugger will first creep -- showing everything (trace)
      #      1      1 Call: cnt(1) ? <kbd>c</kbd>
      #      2      2 Call: 1&gt;0 ? <kbd>c</kbd>
      #      3      2 Call: _2019 is 1-1 ? <kbd>c</kbd>
             3      2 Exit: 0 is 1-1 ? <kbd>c</kbd>
      #      4      2 Call: cnt(0) ? <kbd>c</kbd>
             1      1 Exit: cnt(1) ? <kbd>c</kbd>
     
     % trace
     | ?-
</pre>
   <p>Invocation 1 is ground, its Exit port is not hidden, because
further goals were traced inside it. On the other hand, Exit
ports of ground invocations 2 and 4 are hidden.

   <p>Our second example defines a predicate <code>call_backtrace(Goal,
BTrace)</code>, which will execute <code>Goal</code> and build a backtrace
showing the successful invocations executed during the solution of
<code>Goal</code>.

   <p>The advantages of such a special backtrace over the one
incorporated in the debugger are the following:

     <ul>
<li>it has much lower space consumption;
<li>the user can control what is put on and removed from the backtrace
(e.g. in this example all goals are kept, even the ones that
exited determinately);
<li>the interactive debugger can be switched on and off without affecting
the &ldquo;private&rdquo; backtrace being built. 
</ul>

   <p>The <code>call_backtrace/2</code> predicate is based on the advice
facility.  It uses the variable accessible via the
<code>private(_)</code> condition to store a mutable (see <a href="ref_002dlte_002dmut.html#ref_002dlte_002dmut">ref-lte-mut</a>) holding the
backtrace. Outside the <code>call_backtrace</code>
predicate the mutable will have the representation <code>off</code>.

   <p>The example is a module-file, so that internal invocations can be
identified by the module name. We load the <code>lists</code>
library, because <code>memberchk/2</code> will be used in the handling of the
private field.

<pre class="example">     :- module(backtrace, [call_backtrace/2]).
     :- use_module(library(lists)).
     
     :- meta_predicate call_backtrace(0, ?).
     call_backtrace(Goal, BTrace) :-
             Spec = [advice,call]
                    -[true((goal(M:G),store_goal(M,G))),flit],
             (   current_breakpoint(Spec, _, on, _, _) -&gt; B = []
             ;   add_breakpoint(Spec, B)
             ),
             call_cleanup(call_backtrace1(Goal, BTrace),
                          remove_breakpoints(B)).
</pre>
   <p><code>call_backtrace(Goal, BTrace)</code> is a meta-predicate, which
first sets up an appropriate advice-point for building the
backtrace. The advice-point will be activated at each Call
port and will call the <code>store_goal/2</code> predicate with
arguments containing the module and the goal in
question. Note that the advice-point will not build a
procedure box (cf. the <code>flit</code> command in the action part).

   <p>The advice-point will be added just once: any further (recursive)
calls to <code>call_backtrace/2</code> will notice the existence of the
breakpoint and will skip the <code>add_breakpoint/2</code> call.

   <p>Having ensured the appropriate advice-point exists,
<code>call_backtrace/2</code> calls <code>call_backtrace1/2</code> with a cleanup
operation that removes the breakpoint added, if any.

<pre class="example">     :- meta_predicate call_backtrace1(0, ?).
     call_backtrace1(Goal, BTrace) :-
             execution_state(private(Priv)),
             memberchk(backtrace_mutable(Mut), Priv),
             (   mutable(Mut) -&gt; get_mutable(Old, Mut),
                 update_mutable([], Mut)
             ;   create_mutable([], Mut), Old = off
             ),
             call(Goal),
             get_mutable(BTrace, Mut), update_mutable(Old, Mut).
</pre>
   <p>The predicate <code>call_backtrace1/2</code> retrieves the private field
of the execution state and uses it to store a mutable, wrapped in
<code>backtrace_mutable</code>. When first called within a top-level the
mutable is created with the representation <code>[]</code>. In later calls the
mutable is re-initialized to <code>[]</code>. Having set up the
mutable, <code>Goal</code> is called. In the course of the execution of
the <code>Goal</code> the debugger will accumulate the backtrace in the
mutable. Finally, the mutable is read, its representation is returned
in <code>BTrace</code>, and it is restored to its old representation (or <code>off</code>).

<pre class="example">     store_goal(M, G) :-
             M \== backtrace,
             G \= call(_),
             execution_state(private(Priv)),
             memberchk(backtrace_mutable(Mut), Priv),
             mutable(Mut),
             get_mutable(BTrace, Mut),
             BTrace \== off, !,
             update_mutable([M:G|BTrace], Mut).
     store_goal(_, _).
</pre>
   <p><code>store_goal/2</code> is the predicate called by the
advice-point, with the module and the goal as
arguments. We first ensure that calls from within the
<code>backtrace</code> module and those of <code>call/1</code> get
ignored. Next, the module qualified goal term is
prepended to the mutable representation retrieved from the private field,
provided the mutable exists and its representation is not <code>off</code>.

   <p>Below is an example run, using a small program:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>consult(user).</kbd>
     | <kbd>cnt(N):- N =&lt; 0, !.</kbd>
     | <kbd>cnt(N) :-</kbd>
          <kbd>N &gt; 0, N1 is N-1, cnt(N1).</kbd>
     | <kbd>^D</kbd>
     % consulted user in module user, 0 msec 424 bytes
     
     | ?- <kbd>call_backtrace(cnt(1), B).</kbd>
     % Generic advice point added, BID=1
     % Generic advice point, BID=1, removed (last)
     
     B = [user:(0=&lt;0),user:cnt(0),user:(0 is 1-1),user:(1&gt;0),user:cnt(1)]
     
     | ?-
</pre>
   <p>Note that the backtrace produced by <code>call_backtrace/2</code> can
not contain any information regarding failed branches.  For example, the
very first invocation within the above execution, <code>1 =&lt; 0</code>, is
first put on the backtrace at its Call port, but this is
immediately undone because the goal fails. If you would like to
build a backtrace that preserves failed branches, you have to use
side-effects, e.g. dynamic predicates.

   <p>Further examples of complex breakpoint handling are contained in
<code>library(debugger_examples)</code>.

   <p>This concludes the tutorial introduction of the advanced debugger features.
